B000GB0G7A,0/0,4.0,There is not much to this gloriously inexpensive item. It's stark minimalism is probably what would qualify it as a fashion statement. Just a simple white face with black numerals in a relatively attractive (not comic sans) typeface. Watch strap is rubber...buying the whole watch is cheaper than buying a new strap in most cases. I gave it 4 stars because it isn't anything to rave about...just a watch.,watch
B0000643Q6,2/2,4.0,"Have always loved Movado designs and when I lost my watch a few weeks ago was very tempted to indulge. However, the more I looked online, the chunkier the Movado bands seemed to be. My boyfriend had a very elegant Skagen a few years ago and I began to look at Skagen. Finally settled on this one and am delighted. The design is elegant and clean. I too have a small wrist but was able to move the clasp fairly easily.",watch
B000GAYQJK,0/0,5.0,this watch is cool you can switch the settings around to tell you day off week or date with one button. it lights up really well and the analog hands are glow in the dark. i like that it is analog and digital because my dumber friends that cant tell time on an analog clock can still look at my watch and know the time. i also loke the time zone mode and daylight savings mode so if your traveling you dont have to reset your watch you just tell the watch where you are and it resets itself,watch
B0002XV266,4/42,1.0,"Materialism involves the importance one attaches to their worldly possessions. For a materialist, possessions are central to his or her life in that he or she feels that increased ""consumption"" increases his or her satisfaction with life. Materialism may become a problem in situations where the physical goal of consumption overshadows all other goals of self and development. This does not imply that all material desires are bad. In fact, the acquisition of material possessions may begin to interfere with other important aspects of life. At that point, materialism is likely to become harmful to the person or to society. What is the relationship of materialism to individuals' ethical beliefs? Do consumers who are more materialistic have different ethical standards than those who are not? On one hand materialism may increase a society's economic wealth and material possessions. On the other hand, there are those who would argue that materialism has a negative overall effect on the quality of life. Possessions can be the focus of one's life, becoming more important than religion, friends, and achievements. In making possessions the majority component for achieving happiness, the more materialistic person might be willing to bend ethical rules to gain possessions.What is it that makes us want something so badly? Certainly many marketers have an interest in perpetuating materialism, and as the issue of marketing's social responsibility grow in significance, the topic of materialism surfaces. While many marketing efforts encourage materialism, the materialism that is encouraged may have negative societal effects. Materialism is associated with a greater drive to acquire the goods that marketers provide for consumers. If consumers move away from their focus on material acquisitions and towards non-material quality of life concerns, then they will consume less, leaving the marketers with fewer consumers and less demand for their goods. Though this may be an enormous explosion in the camp of those marketers who provide services that are purchased to increase the quality of life, it would certainly have a negative impact on those companies that provide the goods which feed a materialistic quest. Generally, marketers know the essence of their motivation. They have a goal in mind. However, if they see that what they are manipulating to achieve is wrong, will they abort, or will they proceed with their plans just for their own success? Plato suggests that there is a knowing within us that already exists to help us quickly and easily conform to what we see, but turns in the opposite direction, causing us to look away from what we see (Plato 518). In essence, act like what we see really isn't there. So, many marketers may have self-interest in encouraging materialism. But if materialism is not in the best interest of society, then such encouragement could be considered socially irresponsible.Plato states that there are virtues of the soul that could be developed, just as you can develop your body by exercise, like the virtue of wisdom which always remains, could be useful, profitable, or hurtful and useless (519). Seems like we juggle these virtues and drop them (the ones we want to ignore) on cue. On one hand, materialism may lead to lower ethical standards. As a person starts their materialistic quest, people, religion, values, etc., seems to become less important as possessions become the focus of his or her life. So, when faced with an ethical choice, the acquisition of the goods may begin to take priority over ethical values. Not to mention that fact that the confinement or constraints of time may compound this. Meaning, there is a drive to acquire more and more things, but there is only a limited time to do so, and shortcuts may mean ethical compromises. A materialistic person may be less likely to take the ethical high road when doing so means sacrificing or even waiting to obtain the material things he or she so deeply desires. On the other hand, it could be argued that people who are less ethical tend to be more materialistic. As one strives to meet their social and/or spiritual needs, their focus often at times moves from things to people. In contrast, when one focuses on material possessions, such social and/or spiritual needs begin to take a back seat to acquiring possessions. Concern for others and/or spiritual convictions often, though certainly not always lead to higher ethical standards.Does the way we were raised have anything to do with our materialism? Plato believes there is a relation between the sensual pleasures afforded to us in our youth and our exposure or our lack of exposure as it relates to the ""character"" of our soul. According to Plato, certain tendencies when we were young, and certain gratifications (even eating and drinking), which like heavy weights came with birth, had the ability to bring us down, and turn our affections to subservient and menial things (519). Are we targeted by marketers in our youth? If so, it does raise some interesting issues as it relates to the social responsibility of marketers. If encouraging materialism also encourages lower ethical standards, then it could be certainly argued that it is not in society's best interest to encourage such materialism. If marketers do encourage materialism, knowing that it will result in the additional burdens of society associated with lower ethical standards, then it could also be argued that they are acting in a socially irresponsible manner. However, implications also exist to the opposite (i.e. being less ethical tends to make a person more materialistic). Though encouraging materialism here would not lead to lower ethical standards, it would amount to appealing to those holding lower ethical standards. This could be assumed by some as condoning or even encouraging such lower ethical standards.In conclusion, people who are more materialistic seem to show less concern for ethical issues. Although this does not necessarily mean all people who are materialistic have low ethical standards. Indeed, it is possible and maybe even likely that many materialistic people do have great concerns for ethical issues. However, on average, those being more materialistic do show less concern for ethical standards. In addition, the possibility does exist that causing one to become more materialistic may also cause him or her to have lower ethical standards. If this is indeed the cause, then it could be argued that it is socially irresponsible for companies, at some point, to sell their products by encouraging materialism.",watch

I believe evrybody who does the same will spend hours just playing with the cronograph and wondered by the nice purchase they did.

I loved the easy button for the light up display as I often run at night. However, the first time I decided to try out my watch in the water it got water inside. I was so disappointed, but thought it may dry out. However, the next day it just got worse until the whole watch was ruined.

B000936JGC,0/0,4.0,"I have owned this watch for at least two years. The nicest thing about it beyond the basics is that the back light is bright enough to use as an emergency light. I camp alot and have frequently used the backlight to find my way in and out of my tent at night.Unfortunately, the date feature broke within a week of owning it, but I can get by without that.Also, as shown in the picture, it can be hard to distinguish the hour hand from the minute hand without checking closely.",watch

B0009P66Z4,0/0,2.0,"I own at least 30 Invictas and love most of them. However, their current rage for their most attractive styles is to make BIG watches, 46-50 mil and above. I wanted something in the 42-43 mil range which is how this is advertised. I also liked the fact that the movement was apparently the Myiota movement I have in several of my Invicta automatics. Excellent durable movement. THIS WATCH IS NOT 43 MIL IT IS 40 (I already own one in 40 mil with a nicer dial) AND IT DOES NOT HAVE A MYIOTA MOVEMENT. Sent it back disappointed. By the way, I do own a 43 mil Invicta in brown with a Myiota movement so I know they make or at least made them. I'm growing wary of the new Invictas -- not just size wise -- they are looking somewhat cheaper in quality to me these days.",watch

Just set the watch to your local time zone and you'll never have to set it again - it always has Correct Time (TM). Unfortunately, this watch is a real beast. It's nearly half an inch thick. It's so bulky it's almost comical. If you're a 350 pound linebacker or scuba diver, this isn't such a bad thing, but I'm not, and this thing is really clunky on my wrist.Overall, the features are really nice, and this watch is sturdy enough it could survive being run over with a car, but it's a real monster on the wrist.",watch

B0009NXS34,3/3,5.0,"My 5yo and 6yo daughters asked for a ""real watch"" after they each received an analog watch for Christmas last year, neither of which kept the correct time. We purchased this watch (and the one in pink) after reading the reviews and our own experience with the Timex brand. This watch has more than exceeded their (and our) expectations. The soft-buttery leather strap fits nicely around their wrists - it is not too big (they can wear it on the tightest fitting). The watch face is large enough for them to read the time, altho' as young girls it doesn't appear to be too big in proportion to their body. As well, second-hand has helped them learn more about time. The Indiglo Light is a bonus for fun, altho' now they insist on wearing their watches to bed (even tho' they each have a digital alarm clock). As well, the water-resistant feature is a plus because they still like to get messy and clean up on their own. This is a great watch at an excellent price that I expect they will own for some time and will grow with each of them into their 'tween years.",watch

B000AQVRWO,17/17,5.0,"Casio has been steadily improving their DataBank Calculator Watches and it really shows!-I've learned the expensive way that opening the case to replace the battery in DataBanks invariably results in condensation build up in the case (7 out of 7 times), and the ensuing backwards E's, upside down L's, and other assorted random characters that plague the display within three months make the watch unusable. Its cheaper to just buy a new watch when the battery goes tits-up.-It now takes two fingers, pressing on two buttons on opposite sides of the case to turn the light on. This sure beats a single large button that constantly gets bumped, wasting battery life. The display has been dramatically improved to show day-of-the-week in large font, right above the large, easy to read time display.-The algabraic function is now clearly displayed upon pushing the corresponding button in calculator mode; very important when you are trying to compute your vehicle's mileage while road-raging through rush-hour traffic on icy streets in the darkness!-Current time is now ALWAYS displayed (albeit in a much smaller font) whilst in calculator, stopwatch, dual-time, and alarm set modes!-The buttons on the front pad seem larger and easier to operate, with less effort, yet providing a more definitive tactile and aural acknowledgement; in fact, this watch uses multiple tones, at differing volume levels. This makes the watch more ergonomic and lends a feeling of precision and control.-Finally, while I don't believe for a SECOND that the battery will actually last ten years as Casio foists, even lasting five years will make this watch an absolute bargain.No iPAD, iPHONE, or other iGADGET will EVER replace a CASIO nerd watch on my wrist! WELL DONE, CASIO!",watch

Extremely accurate, my wife has had hers about three months and it's only gained a couple of seconds.Waterproof enough for showering and swimming, and tough enough to withstand the vigors of constant daily wear. I'ts been worn nearly every day and still looks new, not a scratch.The mother of pearl face shifts color very subtly as the watch moves, sometimes grayish sometimes blue-purplish. I think it looks very good with the polished case, and photos don't do it credit. The band has a hidden clasp which gives it a nice finished look when closed.It's just slightly larger than the majority of women's watches, but that makes it more useful and easier to read.I wanted a good reliable watch for my wife, one that looked good and was functional as well.

B000GGOGUI,5/5,5.0,"I spent almost 4 months cruising the offerings on Amazon, Overstock, ShopNBC and various department stores looking for exactly the right watch for me, considering elements of style/image, materials, some prestige, a strong price/value relationship, and quality and found Victorinox Swiss Army to be unsurpassed. It is ruthlessly masculine, with none of the gender equivocation and frilliness of oversized watches, shiny metals, or the implied fragility of 'dressy' models; I like the matte finish, lightness and strength of titanium; ""Swiss Made"" on the dial trumps anything that is not-regardless of price; at $139 it's a bargain (unfortunately, a ripoff at the $325 list); the accuracy is consistant, and it's rugged enough to take the shock from the heavy recoil of large caliber magnum firearms. Gentlemen, look no further, this is your watch.",watch

It even lights up the inside of my dresser, it's so bright. Only draw-backs are the dial is a bit on the small side compared to my usual watches, and the band could be longer (I'm using the last hole). So if your wrist isn't to large and you want to tell the time in the dark, whether it's outside or in a theatre, this one will do the job.",watch
B000E8FG20,67/72,5.0,"The most amazing thing about this watch is that it actually seems to work. I received the newer model which doesn't have any button issue or such and is mechanically very well built. The overall design is not vary stylish, but I don't think that's the point. It looks fine so you might wear it all day or just at night. When I use the watch it may wake me up to 30 minutes earlier than the normal alarm is set, occasionally if sleeping very soundly it just goes off at the set time, which means it never found a better time to wake me up within the window I set. It also logs any major movements I have at night so I look forward to checking the next day especially if I feel extra good or bad or once my dog woke me up and I could see that point too. I never seem to get enough sleep so waking up at a good point in the morning is important to me and this watch tells me exactly when. I'm very happy with it.",watch

I would agree that it wouldn't be a good wake up alarm, tho.3) Bezel turned fine right out of the box.So maybe Citizen has addressed couple of these issues?I do agree with a couple of other reviewers:1) It is pretty BIG and still fairly heavy. But big watches are in fashion these days, so it's really not a big deal.2) I DON'T have ""chubby wrist"" (just the opposite!) as someone else put it, but the knob does get turned and the watch goes into the wrong mode.A ""day of the week"" indicator feature would have been a nice addition...Neither of these issues keeps me from wearing this watch everyday.",watch

LOVE the perpetual calendar. Having just come out of February, this is the only watch I have that I did not have to adjust the date on. I'm still amazed at how long the hands glow in the dark. No light but who needs one!This was my first deployment clasp watch and it took me a while to figure out how to size it, but once I did, I had to laugh because it was so simple. On the underside of the silver bar that goes across the band, there's a little piece that flips up so that you can adjust which hole it engages. The band takes a bit of getting used to, but I now find it very comfortable and easy to use.Love the eco-drive concept. No batteries AND no watch winder. Ambient light seems to be enough to keep it going - I haven't made any special efforts to keep my wrist in the sunlight or anything :). It even has a warning when the charge is low - or so I've read - haven't seen it - where the second hand starts moving every OTHER second (still keeping proper time), so that you can see if it's getting low.Overall, I think that this is a unique and fine looking watch.

B0000C9ZD1,0/0,4.0,"I am so hard on watches and this watch has made it through it all. I LOVE my Skagen and probably will never buy another brand of watch.My particular one is fairly water resistant, I've splashed water in and near it, and even put my hand into the turtle tank once when I had to get the turtle out when the lightbulb got wet, exploding sharp glass all over. I didn't have a moment to take off the watch, so in it went. It came out fine. I do not usually immerse this watch although I don't take it off to wash my hands or scrub dishes before they go into the dishwasher. I wouldn't immerse it often though.In 5 years of ownership, I wore this watch almost every day for the first 4. Then I bought 2 more Skagen watches to expand my ""wardrobe."" That should tell you something right there. Here's my analysis:Pros:*Many Skagens have this mesh bracelet. It is WONDERFUL and I can't say enough about it. Hypoallergenic, breathable like no other band. I'm allergic to everything, my skin is so acidic it will literally eat the chrome finish off of things. Not so with this watch, since it's surgical stainless steel.*In 4 years, I have had to replace the battery once. Great battery life.*Attractive, gets comments.*Flashy flat glass gets attention and if you can't read, just tilt to angle and it works great.*Love the sparkly little crystals.*Matching brushed silver face.*Easily adjustable band. Takes a small screwdriver to pry up the clamping clasp. Easy.*Good locking safety clasp. If the catch gets loose, just give it a little pressure from pliers and it becomes tight again.*Super low profile. Sits close to your wrist which helps out on the first ""con""Cons:*All Skagens have low-quality glass. It does chip, scratch, etc. I'm very hard on watches so it's definitely taken some abuse. It still looks good though-- that was the only thing that made it lose a star. I wish Skagen had a more expensive line with real sapphire crystals, I'd be willing to pay more. They are WORTH IT.*No second-hand.",watch

B000BK96Q8,1/1,5.0,"I own this watch, it's been nothing but perfect in form and function, altho it has the sapphire crystal and display back, it is better suited to someone who is a little tougher on their watches than most. It's a little thicker and heavier than the plastic (Hesalite)crystal versions, without having to polish the plastic all the time. The sapphire display back is a visual to the stunning mechanical movement. There are many who want to keep the Speedy in it's true form of Hesalite crystal and steel back, but these new ones are a step up in my opinion for someone who will wear it daily, the crystal will remain flawless for life and no polishing of the crystal needed. The 863 movement is the same as the 861 except for the Delrin (nylon)Brake. The exibition backed Speedys use a metal brake for appearance, so you don't see a piece of plastic in such an expensive watch. Since I'm not going to do any space travel in the near future the Sapphire Crystal is definately the way to go for scratch resistance and durability and they are heavier which I like. It's a good investment and a beauty to see the movement in motion with the sapphire back. Omega quality at it's finest in a timeless design, it's simply the perfection of form and function in a timepiece. I bought it from Amazon over a year ago and has been stellar thus far.",watch

B0006AAS4M,65/67,5.0,"The Invicta 8926 is typically considered an entry level watch, or a ""beater"" alternative to other more expensive watches in your collection to be worn for everyday tasks. It typically ranks as one of the best selling watches, and provides a nice foray into automatic watches. [...]First Impression:When the box arrived from Amazon, I was pleasantly greeted by Invicta's signature cheese-yellow box. The watch was delicately wrapped, and packed well in the case. Invicta's instruction manual was thorough, and read like it was written by someone that speaks English as a first language. The included warranty card and polishing cloth were also nice touched. I have a small wrist, so when I first put it on, it hung very loose off of my arm. The weight was also unexpected for a watch at this price point. It felt very substantial. After a few minutes, I headed out to the local jeweler to have things sized for daily wear.Cost:Typically found below [...] is an excellent value. there are not many other watches that have an automatic movement and look like a watch that costs 10 times as much. Total shipped, sized, and on my wrist was just over $105. That's unreal! At that price point, if it takes a hit while washing the car or doing yard work, I won't shed any tears.Case:At 43mm, the 8926 is not a small watch. It's an excellent compromise between a HUGE diver, and a smaller dress quartz. I've worn it to the office, business meetings, and around town, and it's been comfortable in all situations. The size of the face in comparison to the bezel is pleasing, and of a fair proportion. One of my objections to the watch is the large engraved ""Invicta"" on the left side of the case. I'm proud to wear an Invicta, but the size and placement of the branding is a bit overwhelming, and breaks up the elegance of the case.Bezel:The unidirectional rotating bezel was quite a surprise. While not as smooth as the Seiko or other high end watches, for $100 the bezel gets the job done. The black silhouettes the face perfectly, and the white marks are easy to read. It turns well, and locks into every number well, while being aligned perfectly with 12 o'clock. I've found myself using the bezel to time everyday tasks, like waiting for food at a restaurant, and sitting on a conference call. Why not right?Bracelet:The standard Invicta bracelet is just amazing on this watch. The weight is so substantial, and it fits extremely well. The diver buckle is fairly easy to operate, though I imagine if you were actually diving with this watch, it may be a bit of a challenge. The inner link on the watch is highly polished, and immediately started to show sign of desk wear. I imagine that over the lifetime of the watch, the links would start to show some serious wear. The watch was also easy to re size. Due to my poor dexterity, I prefer to have a jeweler re size my watches. He had everything completed in less than 2 minutes, and also complimented the watch.Movement:Sporting the Miyota 21 jewel automatic workhorse, I've been impressed with the accuracy of the watch. I tested the power reserve at 36 hours, and it was still going strong. In terms of accuracy, it's tough to gage without ""hacking"" while setting the time. Over the last month, it's ran about a minute fast, which is not surprising given my daily wear, and my impatience in letting the movement settle. Only time will tell (mwahaha) if accuracy is a problem in the long run.The trinite hands glow fairly well for about 2-3 hours, then become hard to read. I hit the face with my Maglite before going to sleep, and about 7 hours later, the glow was faint but adequately visible to read if necessary. It would most likely pass the theatre test, but it's a far cry from a high end watch. The hands are quite beautiful, and easy to read against the black face. the addition of the Mercedes style hand was also a nice touch. The cyclops is good, but not great, and is certainly not a Rolex. It's adequate to read the date, but nothing that will make people stop and say ""WOW"". Finally, the mineral crystal is also great for this pricepoint, but only adequate for the look and feel of this watch. Mine has yet to show any scratches, and I've been polishing ti regularly to try and reveal a hidden one. That being said, I plan on wearing this as my ""beater"" watch, so a scratch is not really a concern. In fact, the last sapphire crystal face I had cracked from a tough hit, so I'd rather have a few small scratches over a broken face.Conclusion:I would be shocked to find a better watch for under $100. Say what you will about Invicta, but for the money, the 8926 is one of the best values ever in terms of an automatic watch. I receive daily compliments on this piece, something I cannot say about my higher end pieces. To the untrained eye, most people thing you are wearing a $1,000 + watch. Despite the flaws with the 8926 (which are well documented), I'm still terrifically impressed with this watch. It's a great entry into a ""real"" automatic watch from a department store quartz, and is a good introduction into the beauty of a living timepiece.",watch

I came upon this seller and shipping was very timely but when I opened it, it was clearly not what I was looking for because the gold tone coloring was off from the original authorized Seiko that I have. Be careful, most buyers would not notice this but because I have bought Seikos before I immediately returned the watch the next day expecting satisfaction guaranteed return. A few weeks later I received the same watch returned to my doorstep basically stating that I messed with the links and some parts were not returned!

I can't count on this watch's alarms to wake me up. It'd be nice if the watch had a power-hog mode with loud insistent alarms and long illuminations.All in all, I like the watch. It is nice to have a digital watch that sets its own time and doesn't run out of batteries. I wish the user interface was more intuitive, the alarms were more effective, and the watch was smaller.**UPDATE** I've had the watch now for two months and have grown to appreciate it even more.

This creates very sharp little ""knife blades"" on the edge of the case. With the stretch band, you have to pull it on/off over your hand.

I sent it back within warranty, they said they had reprogrammed it, or something. Got it back and within a couple months, it did the same thing. They then sent me a new watch. Now, about 6 months later, it is doing the same thing and I am basically screwed. A new watch does not come with the original warranty.What I am assuming, is either I got back the same watch with a different, charged battery and it slowly drained because the solar cell does not work, or it need a tremendous about of light to keep it functioning.

B000CK4FGI,9/16,1.0,"I bought this watch 4 years ago. It is an atomic solar watch that is supposed to NEVER RUN OUT OF POWER. About 6 months ago the watch began to only charge to medium power and then would completely die after about 8 hours! Casio uses a cheap solar cell for these watches and will not admit to this problem or just replace the watch. Casio will make you either pay $90 for service fee to replace the solar cell or you just have to buy a new watch. This is false advertising and this watch is not worth the money. I suggest you buy a better watch with a battery. When the battery runs out after a few years it will only cost you about $10 to replace a battery. Casio should be ashamed of themselves, I have worn a G-shock of one type or another for almost 20 years, but this is blatantly false advertising and I will NEVER own another Casio product.

B000GB1R78,1/1,5.0,"When I was scrolling through the selection of watches, I came across this watch, and I liked it right off for its looks. Even though it's a hybrid digital-analog model, it retains a classic, retro kind of look. I think it looks good. And certainly the price is right. But when it came I was dismayed. It is very plastic. It weighs less than a thumbtack! I wouldn't say it feels chintzy. But it doesn't have the weight that really good watches have. But rather than write it off, I read its thick little manual booklet, familiarized myself with all of its functions, and started wearing it. It is actually a quite versatile and functional timepiece. And it's the first watch I've ever come across that does not have a tiny knob to set the hands with. I didn't spot that anomaly until I received it. You push a combination of buttons to set the hour and minute hands. And, surprisingly, the setting and menu system is straightforward and intuitive. It has turned out to be an inexpensive tool I can really put to practical use. Countdown timer. Stopwatch. World clock. Alarm clock. 12- or 24-hour display. Illuminated dial. No great loss if it's lost or stolen. And it does look good, I think, if you can get past the fact that it's about 95 percent plastic. Once I got used to its featherweight nature, I didn't regret buying it. I wear it on rough assignments. It's holding up well. In all honesty, I think this watch actually may be the best cheap, plastic watch I've ever owned! Really! And so I recommend it. It's certainly nicer, more useful, and easy to figure out than most of the other cheap watches out there. Your mileage may vary, but this watch by Casio is doing right by me.",watch

The case is a bright reflective stainless steel and the bezel has a nice, smooth ratchet-like click to it when it is turned to measure elapsed time. The band is wide, yet flexible and comfortable. Because it has automatic movement, as instructed in the manual,I swayed it back and forth about 10 times after removing from the box to get it started. The date and time were very easy to set and the sweep second hand really adds an exclamation point to the impression of quality and style. This watch replaced a Tag Heuer Formula 1 Chronograph that I had to return because of quality problems. I will follow up this review at a later time with an update.2/6/11 - Follow-UpWatch is still great. It seems to pick up a few minutes over the course of each month, so it needs to be adjusted back to actual time. This is not a problem as I believe that a little too fast is better than too slow. Also, the automatic movement will stop if not worn for more than 16-20 hours, so plan on resetting the time if you don't wear everyday or purchase an automatic watch winder.

B000ETYF44,1/1,5.0,"This is my second Skagen watch and I'm certain I will wear and enjoy this watch for many years (and probably buy more in the future).The band color is great; from a distance it almost looks black, but up close you can see just a hint of brown, making for an extremely appealing--and versatile to match--color. The mesh construction is lightweight and customizable to fit perfectly. There's significantly more length on this than my other watch, but the extra length doesn't get in the way or make it cumbersome. I don't think I could ever wear a clunky link banded watch again after these. The latch is easier to undo than my other watch, so I'm worried it may click open accidentally from time to time.The face plate is really neat. When the light hits it, it radiates a rich brushed caramel color (not nearly as red looking as it is in the photo here on Amazon). When the light isn't directly hitting it, it's a dark chocolate brown, not quite as dark as the band. One surprise was that the days are abbreviated in both English and Spanish (which I really like); I'm not sure yet if they switch every 12 hours or if it stays in whatever language you choose. The case is nice and thin like my other Skagen watch (though not quite as thin), which was a big relief not seeing this in person before buying it. I love the sleekness of these watches. My only mini complain is that the hands and number dashes are not pure silver like I was expecting; they are white with a silver outline, and they glow in the dark. Normally I think this looks tacky, but the glowing applique has been applied so well, it doesn't look tacked on and cheap.I haven't even worn the watch a full day yet, but I'm certain I will get many compliments on it in the future. I would recommend this watch.",watch

I didn't realize it when I bought it that it is a Rolex look-a-like but after receiving several compliments I did a little research and found that it does in fact mirror a Submariner that costs several thousand dollars.

B000EI859G,53/54,5.0,"I purchased Seiko Orange Monster so that I wouldn't mess up my Rolex during weekend excursions. Now I find myself wearing it during the week. Its looks and functionality demand more and more wrist time and I am happy to oblige. The Orange Monster (OM) steers away from the ""classic"" diver's watch design that we have become so accustomed to. I think it has a contemporary classic appeal. This watch is an attention getter. I always receive compliments when in public.Case/CrownThe case is constructed from 316L solid stainless steel and is very large (42 mm) and heavy. You will know when this timepiece is on your wrist. When viewed from the wrist, the watch has a deep profile. It is a little less thick than my Sea Dweller so I am going to guess that is somewhere in the 13 mm vicinity. The case back is decorated with Seiko's SCUBA emblem design which is quite attractive. The 20 mm lugs are a bit angular but I like the masculine look of them. Lug holes are drilled through making bracelet changes an easy task. It also should be noted that the case is constructed in such a fashion that is rises to protect the bezel and crown. This design does not affect the operation of the bezel and is a very well engineered touch. The screw-in crown is large and solid feeling. Lastly since this is such a large watch, the crown has been moved to the 4 o'clock position so that it sits as far out of the way as possible from the hand (when the hand is bent backwards).MovementIt is fairly accurate for an automatic (+15 secs per 24 hrs) beating with a 23 jewel 7S26 movement designed and fabricated in-house by Seiko. Power reserve for me is around 40 hours. The second hand sweep is a little less smooth (21,500 bph) than my Rolex Sea Dweller (28,800 bph) but for the price paid it is totally acceptable. I wish it had a manual wind feature but all it needs is a couple shakes if left alone for over 40 hours. It lacks hack mechanism (where you pull the crown out and the second hand stops) but I am not on a Navy S.E.A.L. team and I have no need to synchronize my watch to the exact second to anything.Dial/Hands/DateThe watch has a great looking dial that is uncluttered and very easy to read. The orange color used on the dial was first introduced by Doxa as their research proved that orange is the easiest color to read as light conditions deteriorate underwater. Hour markers are over sized which is a ""signature"" for this model. Lume is the best I have ever seen on a diver (with exception of my Luminox which uses radioactive Tritium gas filled tubes for markers). Minute and Hour hands are beefy and well lumed. Seiko also has designed the hands so that if the minute hand directly overlaps the hour hand, both are viewable. This is a thoughtful feature as anyone who has ever looked at their watch and thought ""where did my hour hand go?"" will surely appreciate the foresight with which they designed it. The OM includes a Day/Date window that is very legible. The date can bet set to either Spanish or English and the usual black text for weekdays is blue for Saturday and red for Sunday. Date changes do not occur instantly at midnight like on some of the higher end ETA movements. It takes roughly 4 hours (10 pm - 2am) for the date change to occur. It also should be noted the chapter ring (the edge of the dial) curves upwards along she side wall of the case. This gives the watch a deep three dimensional feel and is just one more extra step that Seiko took while designing this incredible watch.BezelBezel action is smooth and expensive feeling. The one-way ring has 120 indents, making it extra precise as it divides each minute by a factor of two. There are large indents along the outside of the bezel, making operation (even with gloves) a cinch. It was a very good design on Seiko's part for them to have the markings on the bezel engraved into the bezel rather than printed. This will add to the longevity of the watch. I like the fact the bezel is a tad higher than the crystal as it provides a bit of protection for the glassCrystalSeiko uses a proprietary compound developed in-house called Hardlex which is less scratch resistant than sapphire crystal but also less brittle. I have smacked the watch on its crystal a couple of times and there is not a single blemish on it...yet! Crystal is also slightly domed and it refracts reflections in a way that make it easy to read in sunlight (sort of a workaround to anti-reflective coatings).StrapThe watch came with Seiko's rubber dive strap. It has stainless steel hardware and robust pins. I would be willing to wager that this is not a natural rubber compound as it does not attract dust. It seems a little stiff but I only wore it for a few days so it might take a little longer than that to break in. I put a NATO strap on mine and now it is perfect for wake boarding, mountain biking, and general weekend mayhem.This is hands-down the best price to performance timepiece produced for under $500.00. I would definitely recommend this watch to anyone with an active lifestyle!!!",watch

I prefer the large case size and Invicta has some of the nicest large case watches.The mother-of-pearl dial is amazing. Not only is it nice to watch in the bright sunlight, but when I am relaxing in a chair at night, just watching the TV, the colors still change and look great in the lower light. The luminous markers are very bright and not overdone.The bracelet is heavy and not cheap feeling. Another Invicta Pro-Diver I own has a lower quality bracelet that does not LOOK cheap, but it feels cheap. When you move your arm around you can hear the noises a cheaply made bracelet makes. This watch does not make those noises.The 44mm case is just over the new men's standard size. It is perfect for me. I have a 7 inch wrist and this bracelet was easy to size myself. Although this is one of the smallest cases I own, I love it.The exhibition case back is a nice touch that allows you to admire the automatic movement. The only negative comment I have about the watch is the metal bar that runs diagonally across the caseback crystall. The watch is heavy and the imprint of the metal bar pushes down into my skin. On one hand, it is annoying. On the other hand, this is a dive watch and the metal bar creates a diver's logo on the skin.For this price, you can not go wrong. Invicta brand, 5 year warranty, automatic movement, mother-of-pearl dial, medium sized case, and quality bracelet all make this a watch you should own.",watch
B000PYGAKU,3/4,5.0,"This watch is an exceptional value as far as dive watches go. My father has a similar model he purchased in the late 1970's that is still 100% functional to this day. This is a testimate to the quality and longevity of Seiko dive watches. Purchased here on Amazon.com for one hundred and twenty six dollars.Case: Beautiful and solid feel. It weighs enough to feel solid without feeling like an anchor on your wrist. With three complications the case is not too thick and doesn't stand off your wrist, this keeps it from looking bulky.Illumination: Very bright and clear. Not as bright as tritium but still very easily readable at night.Band: The band is very nice looking with all stainless steel construction but the links are folded. This keeps the watch light and more comfortable for everyday wear. The downside is that if you move your wrist quickly it will at times make some sound and the folded links tend to grab your arm hair more so than solid links. Seiko brand solid stainless steel link bands for this watch are available online for as little as forty dollars. A possible upgrade that will bring the feel of the watch band up to that of TAG and Omega dive watches.Accuracy: I've tested the watch against an atomic clock and it lost about 8 seconds a day. This is exceptional accuracy for an automatic watch.Movement: After a full day of wear the watch continues to operate unattended for about another day. Keep in mind that this is a self winding watch and that you'll likely have to reset the time/date if you don't wear it every day. Resetting the watch is quick and simple using the single dial on the side.In my opinion there isn't a better dive watch to be had at this price. From past experience with Seiko I know that this watch will serve me without fail for years or decades to come. 330ft of water resistance is more than enough for most divers or those partaking in watersports.Since purchasing this watch I've had nothing but compliments on its looks. It's styling is very similar to that of the Rolex Submariner and I'm able to wear it during activities and in places that might give me pause if I were wearing my Submariner. If you need links taken out check on Seiko's website for dealers in your area. Don't try it at home unless you have specialized tools and experience in link removal. Kohls is a certified Seiko dealer and removed my links for free.",watch

There was nothing there...My next thought was to get out of there, so I hit the adjust button on my watch, tapped MODE a few times and reset the date to ...Oh...No...I could only get back to 1990.So, here I sit, broken-hearted...logged on to Compuserve on the dial-up in my mom and dad's basement. Glad the other ""me"" was at summercamp this week and I can play the part of a distant cousin. If I can ever get home, my kids will never believe this...wait....I don't have kids yet..or do I?

B000IK0COQ,15/16,4.0,"This was purchased as a gift. After receiving it, it was a battle to let it go and not keep it myself. It has a very minimalist design but with quality construction. The leather on the top has a lizard texture but with a rich feel. The only negative is that there is no metal hinge but only two strips of fabric that prevent the lid from falling back. I don't know how this will hold up to active use and a metal hinge assembly would have been a much better design choice. But other than that it was well worth the price and highly recommended. Four stars only for the lack of a hinge assembly.",watch

B000GAWSCM,8/8,5.0,"This watch is easier to use than the previous version!I owned the previous version for 7-8 years until it broke. I hesitated to buy this (based on the previous review), until I looked at the instruction manual via Amazon, which made me realize it's easier to use than the older one!They figured out the problems with the old one (buttons too small, too many button pushes to get to each mode), and fixed them.It still isn't perfect: letter entry means cycling through the number and the 3 letters per button to get to the one you want (4 choices, up from the 3 you had before, because to make the buttons bigger they reduced the number of buttons and fit more on each); you have to learn a fair amount from the manual to use it; case and watch, tho better, are still the standard, (not impressive looking) brushed steel look you get at this price.I disagree with the previous reviewers complaints: each mode is easier to get to, and they're ready to use when you get there (no extra pushes: you do have to wait a couple seconds for the display to change, but you can start entry right away, and the display catches up).You can't enter as many alarms on specific days (limit 5) as before, but I never entered more than that anyway - this really isn't a replacement for a PDA, it's an addition that I use for the most critical information and reminders.All in all, about the best you can do with this amount of space, I'd say.

I spend both in the office working as a physician and in military aircraft as a rated aviator, and find this watch works well in both environments. In the office, it is lightweight (thanks to the Titanium), professional appearing, and quite functional thanks to easy to read hour/minute/second hands and being water resistant (no worries about ruining the watch because of hand washing). On board aircraft, I have glow-in-the-dark hands and a steady reference to Zulu (UTC) time, as well as having a wiz wheel to show that I have some idea about what is going on (although with modern cockpits, it's somewhat redundant -- and, worth noting, hard to read the dial in low light conditions). At home, the UTC time is helpful for pursuing my hobby of astronomy, as most references to astronomical events are listed in UTC time.The watch is somewhat initially confusing, but once you review the instruction manual or included CD, it is one of the easiest to operate watches I've owned.One other item worth noting is that it is somewhat more grey in color than the photo on Amazon.com appears.Overall, a great value!",watch

B000EQRYPO,14/15,5.0,"I just got this watch, and it's hard to take my eyes off it. I looked at the Calibre 8700 with the blue dial and stainless strap (which a Citizen rep told me is one of their most popular models) but really found the white dial and silver accents, very striking in this model. And I like how the band sets off the face.I really looked at every Citizen watch on their website, and kept coming back to this one!! The watch is very nice in person, the dial has some detail to it, so it catches the light especially with the silver accents.As mentioned in other reviews, there are four basic modes that you can switch to:1. Time2. Calendar3. Local Time (i.e. time zone #2)4. Alarmsince it's not a digital watch (and we don't want it to be since it looks great as an analog!) the hands have to show you all the stuff. So if the Time is set to 3p and you are traveling and are in Singapore where it's 3a, then when you switch the modes, it's going to spin the hands around for 12 hours to show you. This is not good if you want to check and see what time it is 'back home' but is great if you travel, and don't want to keep resetting your watch. When you get back home, just change the dial back to Time and you're back in business.There are three dials on the watch, in addition to the main hour/min hands, one is a 24 hour dial, with an 'hour' hand that points to the corresponding time in 24 hour mode. Basically this will help you distinguish AM and PM times on the dial, and is important when using the local time (i.e. time zone #2) and alarm modes to keep AM and PM straight.Next there is the mode dial that points to TME, CAL, LTM, or ALM to let you know what mode you are in (time, calendar, local time, alarm). And lastly there is a dial that points to the day of the week, can let you know if the alarm is set or not, and can also let you know if this is a leap year, or how many years it's been since a leap year ;)The watch also has a day of the month indicator at the 4 o'clock position, and this is a perpetual calendar, so regardless of 30, 31, or 29 days in the month, it will always be right!As mentioned earlier, the watch has an energy saving feature which, when in the dark for about 30 minutes and not getting enough light to charge the watch, will stop the second hand at 0(12) to save energy. When light hits the dial, it will move the second hand rapidly to where it should be :)I will add that yes, this is a cool watch with lots of cool features, and you might have to do a bit of reading to figure them all out if you want to use them, but basically Citizen tries to make that as easy as possible. They give a detailed instruction book, they give interactive lessons on a free CD that comes with the watch, and you can go on their website and they will visually demonstrate the features to you too! What more can you ask for?",watch
B000B55AEA,4/8,2.0,"If you have a small wrist, this watch is too bulky, 35mm case size. Timex should make a case size around 30-33mm for men with small wrists. The leather band is too thick and my sleaves bunch up over it.",watch
B00024CBDS,5/5,5.0,"I typically wear tool watches, nice big ones. But I needed a dress watch that will fit under my shirt cuffs. Skagen makes some of the slimmest watches I have ever seen so I thought I'd give them a go.I was surprised by how inexpensive Skagen watches are. I found this one at Costco for $29.99. A steal for a this steel watch if you ask me.This watch is very thin at 6.5 mm, and feels nice on the wrist. It feels more like a bracelet than a watch given how even the weighting is. The picture understates how attractive this watch is on the wrist. That said this watch probably won't get you notices (which is what I wanted). It is a nice clean design and the small size does not draw attention to it. This is probably the counter to some of the more ridiculous Invecta watches I have seen.It has a mineral crystal, and nice Moya quartz moment (Japanese). The case back is press-on and the crown does not pull out, simply turns. The watch is rated at 3 ATM, which is enough to allow you to wash your hands. This is not a watch to wear in the water, but I already have a nice TAWATEC divers watch. The manual is rather clear on how you should interpret the water resistance ratings, and what type of activities you should think of pursing with the rating your watch has.I was also thrown by how to adjust the bracelet size. Instructions would have been helpful, and saved me 10 minutes of head scratching. Once you understand that you have to push the pins out in the direction indicated on the back of the bracelet, it is a straight forward process to re-size it.Bottom line I'm very happy with this watch, especially at the price. If you are buying this watch as a gift, remember to take the price-tag off. They will think you spend significantly more on the gift than you did.",watch

I was also told that Amazon isn't an authorized dealer and thus my Swiss Army warranty doesn't apply.

The hands glow brightly in the dark and are easy to read, with my only complaint about that being that it would be useful to have a different glowing marker at the 12:00 position so you could see which way is ""up"" in the dark (all the glowing hour marks are round dots with no differentiation). There is a black cab on the knob, which is also a pretty detail. Yes, the diamonds are small, but the key to this watch is that it's subtly elegant, not bling. Buy it for the overall effect, not because you want to blind people with your wrist accessories. I wasn't disappointed in the pink either, as I think a darker shade would have been too dark for me. It easily goes from casual to dressy, and the metal link band is of course a plus; no leather to wear through.Definitely love this watch and plan on wearing it for as long as it lasts.",watch

Originally, I bought this as a daily beater to alternate out with my solar atomic G-Shock but it quickly replaced it as my primary casual wear watch.One star off because the jubilee band that comes with it feels pretty cheap band with hollow links. I personally dislike the jubilee style anyway, as I find it too gaudy, so I planned on replacing it with a NATO strap from the outset, which looks quite sharp with the Seiko.In conclusion, while you won't be impressing anyone who turns their nose up at anything less than a Patek, the SKX007 offers good looks and functionality at a screaming deal - just don't expect the factory bracelet to be Tiffany.",watch

B00065FWR0,0/0,5.0,"First off, like other reviewers have mentioned this is NOT a large watch. It is about 1 3/8 inches horizontally across from the tip of the crown to the other edge of the case. If you need a huge watch to prove your manliness, keep searching. If you want a watch that has an accurate Japanese quartz movement, a watch that weighs only 19 grams that you will forget you are wearing, is super low profile (which helps keep it from catching on things or scratching it), fits under a sleeve with ease, will not slide down your arm when you lift your hand over your head, has GREAT contrast and can be easily seen in dim light, is water/ rain resistant so long as not submerged in water, and a 2-3 year battery life all for under ten bucks shipped to your house, then this is it.The entire length of the watch is 9 inches, but the effective length from the last hole to clasp is about 8 inches. If you have a huge wrist this watch may not look good nor fit you well. The stainless steel case back can be pried off from the 12 o'clock position (from the back), and the battery CAN be replaced. Out of curiosity I did pop the case and the watch has a Japanese Miyota movement inside (which is apparently made by Citizen watch company), and has a Japanese Sony 626sw battery that appears you must loosen a very small flat head screw and slide a little metal arm out of the way to remove the battery. When doing this be careful not to touch or remove the rubber seal around the outer edge or you may lose the water resistant ability if it comes out of its groove. When you push the case back on it goes it pops in place nicely and rather snug.The watch does not tick loudly, and I like the look of it which is very classic. No one will mistake it for a high dollar watch but people may notice it easily for its super white dial and clean look. I have a medium to smaller sized wrist and I like the look of it on me. After having worn it a couple weeks now I honestly think my other more expensive watches are starting to look excessively large and gaudy when I wear them. Having a plastic case and relatively thin resin strap it most likely will NOT be able to withstand the abuse that a G-Shock will, but if cared for will always reliably tell you the time even down to the second.",watch

I am still waiting, and will report back when I know something.Follow-up: The watch was returned within 2 weeks, and now works perfectly. It was a perfect Mother's day gift, except that it is a bit thicker on my mother's wrist than I realized it would be. She is fairly fine boned, and should probably have something more delicate.

B000GAYQKY,1/1,5.0,Overall this is a simple durable watch. When i received it in the mail it was in perfect condition without issues. It took me 10 minutes to sync my watch with no issues or complaints. Granted i have not yet tested the alarm im confident it functions properly. I wear this watch to work and it serves its purpose so i would highly recommended this to anyone wanting a simple casual watch.,watch
B000026D6I,20/20,5.0,"I read every single comment posted here before buying my Jukebox today. Most everything I saw people complaining about has been resolved with 2.56 firmware, and PlayCenter 2.1. The only thing not addressed was the battery life, which is hard to fix with software. You can now scan through songs by holding the skip button. Songs can be put in track order, and the data transfer rate jumped from 500k to over 3m.I love this device, and don't know how I lived with my Rio 500 (even with an extra 64 meg card) for so long. I still plan to use my Rio 500 because it is so much more portable, but this is great for my hour and a half commute to work, and while I'm at work (I'm a programmer, I just sit at a desk all day, so it doesn't have to be that portable).I haven't filled up the 6 gigs yet, but I see this as my only complaint, I really think 6 gigs is not enough. I have over 20 gigs in my personal collection right now, so there is NO WAY I'm going to be able to &quot;Take my whole CD collection with me&quot; as everyone says, but I can take a big chunk of it with me. I looked at some of the other devices (some which go up to 81gigs), but none of them had nearly the same feature set that the Nomad does. Plus I know and trust Creative. I knew with all the people complaining about not being able to scan tracks that it wouldn't take long for a firmware upgrade to come out to fix that, and by time I looked on their website it was already there!Price is not an issue. The Remote Solution 6 gig is still(much more), and it doesn't look anywhere as cool as this beauty. And it's lacking IR, and Line In recording. It has a better battery life but I wan't too worried about the batteries, since I'll usually be plugged in.I know it's missing some battery life, but since I don't care about that, I'm giving this the full five stars.",watch

I will definitely be taking this watch with me the next time I go hiking.Some people have reported problems with the date function not working/being unreadable, but so far it has worked very smoothly for me; the numbers are small but I don't find the display particularly hard to read, though I understand how it could be a problem for someone with older eyes or who is nearsighted in general.In summary, I can give this watch a hearty recommendation.

In the last few months however, my screws started falling out one by one and now I only have one out of the four that I need. I tried contacting Invicta, and like others, I tried 4-5 times before getting through. They told me twice that they would ship the screws, but never did. After two months of waiting, I decided to write them a letter only to get a postcard back saying I needed to mail the watch in, at my expense, and pay $20 for them to ship it back. How frustrating??!! I don't need it serviced, I only need 3 little screws that are probably worth $.50 that never should have fallen out in the first place.

B000B545B4,0/0,5.0,"I was pleasantly surprised with this watch. Not only does it have the basic time\ alarm functions, but it is also a tiny computer with an 8 bit processor that you can program yourself, if you'd like. The software that comes with the watch is more than enough for most people. I use this watch to remind me of appointments, and keep track of different time zones. I like the fact that I can do all my data entry from a PC, then have it downloaded to the watch. This is one watch that I plan to keep for a long time, and I'm going to buy few more as gift for family and friends.Update:- September 16, 2012:- Few months ago, the watch started goofing up and not syncing reliably with the PC. I would have been fine purchasing a new one since the one I have served me well for few years under rainy, cold, and tough conditions. I did not take it easy on the watch, and it's still running (other than not syncing).The features I used the most are:-- Looking up times in different time zones- Selecting favorite time zones and only scrolling through these- Having a crown to scroll through entries. Made scrolling fast- Space Invaders mini game- Notes application, where you can keep some passwords, pins, phone numbers, etc.- Very decent battery time life.

B000CK4FGI,26/33,2.0,"I have a friend who recommended G-Shock watches as being indestructible, and his apparently were. So I got a model exactly like this one except with a metal band. It had all the cool features of solar recharging, synchronizing with the U.S. atomic clock, water resistance down to 200 m, stop watch, alarm, everything except the temperature gauge. It worked real well for about one and a half years of normal wear and tear. I did not put it under more stress than a regular watch would have been put under. But it started to come apart at the seams. The lower part of the watch where the band connects started to separate from the band.I thought this should not be a problem. After all, a watch whose indestructibility Casio had such confidence in would surely be covered under a warranty. In fact, I would think they would want to know that one of their watches had not lived up to their high standards. But when I contacted Casio, they informed me that their indestructible watch only had a one year standard warranty, just like all their regular products. I would have to pay for them to repair their indestructible watch. I was out of luck! But the watch still worked, and so I kept wearing it.Just today (about two years after the purchase), I took a swim with my waterproof watch, and it is now dead with water plainly showing itself on the inside of its screen.Let the buyer beware, this watch is not at all indestructible.

When you tilt the watch in your wrist from the horizontal position the back light lits up automatically. Overall a good everyday watch. Reasonably priced.This is an update. When I use the data function I used the tip of a pencil to use the keyboard because the numbers were tiny. I found out that the tip of my finger works just as well.

Just two weeks ago, when I was doing some job at field, I noticed that one of the strap parts developed tiny cracks. They were just near the hole which I am using to tighten the strap, at the place where strap is bent in and out most often. In two or three days, watch just fell off my wrist while I was typing in my PC. The strap was completely torn. I found that strap became very brittle. Several bends in and out made it to break at another place once again.The original strap for this model costs 38 $ with delivery which is IMHO very expensive, but this is not a problem. I am more upset by the fact, that my Casio turned out to be not so bullet proof as advertised, although this watch did have very moderate life so far.And I could pay even 38 $ for this strap, being sure that it would last enough, but I don't trust to this strap any more.

That is, with some VERY minor variations and model numbers. I ONLY take it off when I shower. With a very expensive watch there is concern about it getting lost or stolen, while this is replaced by the price of one restaurant dinner. It has ALWAYS been totally reliable, and the battery lasts for something like 7 years. The band lasts a long time. In the rare instance when the battery or band does give up, I have a watch repair guy who does the replacement inexpensively. REPLACEING THE BATTERY: This probaly isn't for the average person to do, because it requires taking it apart in a moderately ""deep"" way, and you need to be handy, patient, careful and calm, as well as have a decent quality tiny screwdriver. It IS possible --- the owner's guide helps, and I just did it! Also replacing the band is not easy. You'd need a special tool for the posts, so I have it done for me. These are not ""cons"" --- the watch VERY RARELY needs any service, and I feel sure that it's the most cost-effective way to have a RELIABLE watch on your wrist. Regarding functionality, it has everything I (and I think most people) need, without unwanted features that get in your way. At a glance it shows the weekday and date. (I always know what month it, so it works well for me that the month isn't displayed.) The alarm is simple to use and totally reliable, and you get a count-up timer. I guess Casio has kept the same model line for so many years because people like me who have owned it feel strongly about it. With a huge amount of physical abuse the body may break after 20 years.

He said, thanks, it's an Invicta. So I started looking at this brand. Holy cow, an automatic watch for $100? I'm in.This is a handsome watch. It's got a bold design and I like its heavy, masculine steel band. Looks good on my wrist.But on closer inspection, it's got about the same fit and finish as a fake, Tijuana Rolex. The machining is clumsy. For example, it's got a screw-down crown (good), but the knob is rough, the tension spring is too stiff, and you have to futz with it to make the threads match up when screwing it down. The clasp is thin stamped metal, and again, you need to futz with it to get it to line up before it will snap shut.I'm not comparing this to real Rolexes or Omegas. Never owned one of those. I'm comparing it to watches in its list price range; Seikos and Wengers and Citizens. A $150 Seiko has far better quality than this Invicta.I'm going to keep this and put it in the rotation. I'll wear it to work periodically. But if I was looking for a daily driver, this wouldn't be it. You can get the same quality for less, or a much better watch for not much more.

B00093CZV0,7/9,4.0,"I have a Timex Ironman Traithlon Sleek 50/100 (T54281) that lives up to its name--sleek. My partner needed a new watch, so I ordered this one so we wouldn't have the same watch. When it arrived, I was a bit surprised at how big it is compared to the Sleek 50/100, and when he put it on, it was just too big for him (he's only 5'7"" and I'm 6'0""), so I gave him my watch and kept this one. It took me a while to get used to the size of it, but I've grown accustomed to it. Aesthetically, I still like the Sleep 50/100 better, but functionally, I like it as much as I've liked any of my previous Ironman watches.One thing I noticed about the Sleek watch that I hadn't noticed on previous Ironman watches is that it is very easy to change modes when you bend your hand back like you might when lifting weights. Even though the size surprised me, one reason I ordered it was that I thought its bulkiness and protective protrusions around the mode button might keep it from changing mode when working out. They don't. Wear it while pressing a few pounds, and you will most likely change it from from one mode to another.I only gave it four stars because the FLIX function requires you to really shake your arm to make the INDIGLO light up. It's easier to just press the INDIGLO button with your other hand--assuming you have one and it is free. :) If money is important to you, I'd recommend the cheaper non-FLIX versions. Otherwise, this watch is a great buy for anyone who likes Ironman watches, wants to save a little money over purchasing one in a sporting goods store, and doesn't mind wildly shaking your arm to invoke the FLIX function.",watch
B000H6AQ0Q,69/80,4.0,"This is a a very attractive watch which is definitely a plus. Also, the watch is relatively easy to use. However there a few drawbacks. For example, after thirty minutes, the watch no longer records seconds, only minutes. This unfortunately makes this watch futile unless you are a beginner and are not too concerned with precision. I wouldn't recommend this watch for a serious or experienced runner. ( I am a sprinter that has taken up cross country thus i found this watch served its purpose considering I was running cross country to improve in sprinting events). Another major drawback is the lack of directions with the watch. I mean I understand the watch is only twenty bucks but can I get some fricking directions????!!!",watch

What you are actually getting is an oversized watchband that the vendor is apparently unloading since it can't get rid of any other way with an attached watch. The product description clearly states that the band is a men's standard. It is not.

NOT CARTIER!!!I bought this CARTIER watch in Jan 2011 for my wife. It stopped working in July 2011. CARTIER said they can't help me, because I didn't buy it from an Authorized CARTIER dealer and did not have an ""Official CARTIER Warranty Card.It took 4 phone calls to Amazon to resolve this issue.

B000AR7RUO,1/1,4.0,"I had been looking at all the the retro Casio digital watches and settled on this one because it was the simplest and cheapest. Coming from an analog watch I wasn't sure I would like switching to digital so I didn't want to invest a lot of money in a watch I might not wear. I really like the fact that it has no bells and whistles; time and date are the only things to set, making it very easy to set once and forget about. The recessed buttons disappear nicely under the case and are not difficult to press when needed. I took off a star because the watch band is shockingly skinny by modern standards. The band is only about 14 mm across for much of it's length, making it look rather delicate and, dare I say, ladylike across the inside of the wrist. If you are man enough to wear such a slender band I heartily recommend this watch.

Throw it on a concrete floor, knock it on steel, drop it in sand or hot water or use it as a hammer -- it keeps on working. OK, my Timex got a few scratches on the silver colored part and I wash it from time to time in soap to clean it after wearing 24x7, but that's it.2. water resistance, shock resistance, timer, stopwatch, indiglo display3. resin band. My previous Timex had a fast wrap band that wore off in a couple of years and then the watch got washed off by a big sea wave. A resin band won't have this problem.4. unbeatable pricethere are probably many other brands of watches out there that will endure all kinds of wear and tear, but not for thirty bucks. You'll pay much moreand then it becomes jewelry. You buy insurance for it, show it off, treat it nicely, dust it off, and leave it for your grandchildren.Cons:1. you may hit on start/split button by accident when in chrono or timer mode because the button is so big.2. ""flick of the wrist"" feature mentioned in the manual doesn't work. It worked once or twice, then stopped working.3. some folks mentioned the problem with the band retainer or whatever it is called. Funny enough, I was able to fix it by simply rotating that thing so that the hole in it that should be on (fitting the jut on the band) is not at the bottom (and not seen). Takes 3 seconds to do.4.

Whether I am wearing a shirt and tie for work, a t-shirt and shorts at the gym, or swimtrunks at the beach this watch never looks out of place. The analog face is a silvery-gray with golden hands and dots at the numerals. It glints slightly enough to look classy, but not to the point where it's distracting. It's low key, low maintenance, and waterproof to boot! I wear it almost 24/7! The digital clock at the bottom is subtle, yet clear, with different features such as an alarm and stopwatch. My only complaints are that the face of the watch is plastic and scratches somewhat easily. While the scratches are usually all but invisible except when viewing up close, under light, and at the right angle it is still worth mentioning that it isn't the most durable of watches. I've had the band of this watch snap once, and I found that replacing the band costs about as much as the watch did in the first place -which isn't much at all.

Never having to worry about a dead battery or the hassle of buy or replacing one.

When looking at the watch in the dark, if you do not recall how you orientated the watch when you put it down, you can't tell which mark is 12:00 and you have to touch it to find the stem to tell the proper time.

B0007OER12,90/101,3.0,"My review closely follows ""toughcrowd"" who wrote an excellent and detailed review.(...)Remember that the bezel is bi-directional in keeping with the concept of the watch. There's no ratchet/spring device to keep it from moving around which for me was aggravating.The background UTC and 24 hour subdials are ok with me but should have been designed better to allow for larger time markers. Given the choice I'd rather have larger markers than the two subdials which are not a necessity.The digital clock/date window is too small and has black LCD figures on a gray background. It needs to be larger and the background color more contrasting with the digits for better visibility. It's hard to read the digital time or date even in daylight. The digital clock and date are useless at night due to no background light.The time markers and hands do have illuminous coatings. But the hands and markers are so small that they are too dim at night. My experience was that the coatings only held light for a short time-certainly not overnight.The lack of half-hour time adjustment is unfortunate but will only affect those in Newfoundland, Suriname, Iran, India, Sri Lanka, and Central Australia. Suriname, Iran and Sri Lanka are not on my travel list so this is almost inconsequential.The alarm volume is way too low and not adjustable.If you have a skinny wrist and have to take a few links out the watch may become uncomfortable as it did for me.This indeed is a nice looking watch with many functions but you have to consider its limitations as well. The numerous features and functions of the Eco-Drive are still quite impressive. Except for the Arabic numeral bit, this timepiece is loaded with amenities. It's difficult to find a quality solar-powered watch with so many functions.I cannot find anyone or any study that shows titanium is more prone to surface damage than stainless steel. In fact it is twice as strong, a third lighter, and is extremely corrosion resistant compared to stainless. Unless you like the polished look of stainless, which is less expensive, go with titanium. I've also researched analog/digital watches solar watches and Citizen is the way to go. The 5-year warranty and the Amazon price are outstanding as well-the retail price is $575.00.Having said all of that, I ended up returning the watch. The clincher was the uncomfortable feel when I took the links out to fit my relatively skinny wrist. I give the 51L a marginal recommendation but look forward to continued evolution in design from Citizen and others in the solar/chronograph category. The Skyhawk should rely less on the Blue Angels motif and more on functionality.",watch

B000GB1R5K,80/81,5.0,"After about seven years of great service, my wrist now bears a dead AMW320D (great name, eh, really trips off the tongue). I went in for my third battery replacement and the jeweler told me that corrosion had eaten away at the movement. The first time I replaced the battery I learned that the seal had to be broken and the watch might no longer resist water. The soft rubbery plastic strap died long ago, replaced by a superior twist-o-flex-style metal wrist band.Now you might think I'm dissatisfied. But I intend to order another the minute (or so -- I don't have a working watch) I finish writing this review. Why? It has been a great watch. Analog plus digital gives me easy-to-read intuitive time checking, along with all the bells and whistles of silicon: multiple times, alarm, stop watch, and calendar. The outer ring on the face lets me rotate the ""north"" arrow to a future time, say 45 minutes from now, and I know time's up when the minute hand gets there. (I have no idea why the face ring has compass points and degrees marked on it -- to fool one's friends?) The watch has been rugged, holding up to the shock of using hoes and axes, although I didn't push my luck if I remembered to take it off.I'm looking at my old friend, now motionless and blank, and figure he had a pretty good run. Time's up for this timepiece, at a cost of a little more than $10 per year. Since I bought the last one on display at Mervyn's, I didn't get a box or manual and didn't even know what it was called AMW320D until looking it up on the web just now.

It's tough, it's waterproof, it's functional, it has lasted without flaw or problem.

B000FPVUK4,0/0,4.0,Well I bought this watch not to long ago. I really love it! I got it so I can use it when i go snowboarding in back country! I have found it very useful! It is a great looking watch. I'm not a watch wearer so it took me some time to get use to it. (But feels better then any-other watch i have had in the past). But the only question I have for this watch is can I use it in salt water? And there are 2 different depths it says on this page! 100m(330f) and 200m(660f) and that is a big difference! I am taking a diving course at my college and i am wondering if I can use it for light diving under 600 feet! Or if I can use it at all in salt water! Its a really cool watch and I always find my self playing with it! GREAT FOR THE MONEY$$$$,watch

My husband has been hinting around about a Fossil/Relic watch and he will be happy with this one. I will definitely buy more Fossil/Relic watches in the future as they are very attractive and have the weight I want in a mans watch and a price tag that doesn't make me ill.

B000F1OGWW,3/3,1.0,"I purchased this watch with the thought of ruggedness in mind. I was impressed with the style when I first received it. I noticed that most of the positive reviews here were from customers that also enjoyed the looks and haven't had the watch for a long period of time. Also note that reviews on this watch on other websites explain the same problems. After about a month a noticed that from moving indoors to outdoors, Condensation could be seen under crystal. Not even near as water resistant as they advertise. The watch battery ran down after 2 months. No big deal, I replaced it. Then, Because the case is plastic, the wristban bar wore out the hole on the case so that the watch kept falling off. O.K. I JB welded the hole and made it smaller once again. Next the tritium gas tube fell off the second hand. and floated around inside the case. I was beginning to get annoyed. So a few days later the gas tube got stuck under the hour hand a jammed the movement. I was able to free it up but was not confident in the watch at this point. It ran for another 5 days and then stopped on it's own. Frazzled, I placed it in my workbench vice and destroyed it. I felt so much better. After all of this I would suspect that you would ask, ""Why didn't you have it serviced under the warrenty?"" Well, That's because if you go to their website, there warranty and replacement policy is an absolute JOKE! They expect you to jump through hurdles to get this watch even looked at. Ridiculous! Don't buy it! Get a Citizen, They actually care about their customers!",watch

The presentation is beautiful, with the red box and hardbound user manual. It is durable, handsome, and keeps great time! The face is a bit crowded, but that's why it is the ""reduced"" version, it's smaller overall. The only drawback is the acrylic crystal. It was made that way so if it broke in space the astronauts wouldn't get hurt, as it wouldn't break into pieces like glass, but it can scatch easily, so I recommend taking it off for any chores or physical activity.

It was right after Christmas and she either felt charitable or sorry for me so she did it for free. It took her less than a minute. It is keeping very good time. As for people that complain about the magnifying bubble over the date, I like it because I hate squinting to see the date. The blue dial and outside minute bezel are beautiful. I own a whole drawer full of watches and this is my favorite. Until I buy another Invicta of course. It comes in a nice (huge) yellow leatherette box with a soft cloth to polish it up with.

I've tried repeatedly since then to reach the seller with no success. Amazon is working on a reimbursement for me via their A-to-Z Guarantee claim process.

B000GAYQKO,5/5,1.0,"I used to love this watch. In fact, I've owned three of them over the years - all virtually identical. Sure, they only lasted me a few years each, but for the price you shouldn't expect Rolex reliability. When they are working, they are great - a lot of good features, reasonably attractive, very accurate.HOWEVER, my latest one lasted only long enough to get splashed on a log ride at an amusement park. I'm guessing that the seals/gaskets were improperly installed and water leaked inside the case. I know that it was on my wrist for a little less than a month before it got splashed and now it had stopped dead.No problem, I thought, as it warranted for a year and is supposed to be water resistant to 50 feet. ""I'll just send it to Casio for repair or replacement,"" I said.So I sent it to Casio's west-of-the-Mississippi warranty repair facility called The Time Machine. They sent me a card saying repairs would be free, but they needed $9.95 for shipping and handling. I sent the $9.95, noting that now the shipping both ways has just about equaled the original cost of the watch. Oh well, it's worth it to get the watch fixed - I really liked the watch.Imagine my surprise when I received a box from The Time Machine a week later, containing my still-dead watch! A cryptic notation on the invoice said ""Physical damage voids the warranty."" THERE WAS NO PHYSICAL DAMAGE! I can only surmise that The Time Machine thinks that splashing water on the watch constitutes ""physical damage"".A series of email exchanges with Casio yielded no better suggestion than I send it to their east coast facility at my own expense. No thanks, Casio, that would make this experience exceed the cost of a new watch.So I'll throw this watch away and get a new watch, but not another Casio. Despite my good experiences in the past, Casio's failure to honor their warranty has soured me on their products.If you buy this watch, enjoy it, but don't get it wet. Most are water resistant; some clearly are not!",watch

B000AQVS78,1/2,5.0,"I have been wearing this watch on a daily basis for about a month now, and I can't just stop looking over and over at it, not necessarily reading the time but the watch itself. Apart from the fact that this is a sister-model of what they call 'M:i:III' limited edition G-shock, it simply looks great and tactical-ish enough by itself.The size is not too big, unlike my initial concern before placing an order, nor too thick either if you're used to other G-shock models. Of course it's slightly heavier than plastic/PU G-shock models because of its high proportion of metal parts, but not to the extent that it'll drag your wrist down. I rather enjoy its subtle heaviness and sturdy feeling.One of the problems I have is that my current/future location is/will remain beyond reach of any atomic wave transmission this particular North American version is tuned to, but that's a price I thought I would gladly take, so not a big deal. The other thing is it's quite tricky to adjust the bracelet length, but a bit of patience and a needle would sufficiently do the job.Conclusion: this is a highly recommended model whether you're a G-shock fan or not! :D",watch

B000H6AQ0Q,6/7,1.0,"I was initially pleased with my Timex 1440 watch when I received it two months ago. Even though the button operations are different from and more limited than other Timex watches I've owned, it had the features I wanted (namely and alarm and stopwatch) and it wasn't too hard to use once I got used to it.However, after two months of daily use the watch stopped working. It is stuck at 7:20 p.m. and does not respond to any button pushes. I never immersed the watch and I didn't do anything more than your average day to day living while wearing the watch. I looked up the warranty information for the watch and found that it would cost $7.00 to get the watch repaired or replaced - almost half the cost of the watch! At this point I'm not sure if I'd be throwing good money after bad by trying to get it repaired/replaced or if I should just give up and buy something else.I would not suggest buying this watch - while it is an attractive price, decent looking, and functional, it just doesn't seem to last. And while there is a warranty, paying half again the price of the watch to get it repaired/replaced seems like a pretty raw deal.",watch

In fact, I think the strap length might be a little short for some.The chronograph feature is a little hard to figure out, but may just because of my lack of experience. Took me a while to realize that the 1/10th second hand wouldn't rotate constantly (since it would wizz around), but when you push ""stop"" it moves to the appropriate 1/10th second point.Its a Christmas gift so I have to put it away for a few weeks, but I synchronized it with an atomic clock reading about 1 week ago and it is still accurate to within 1 second.I bought this from Jonashop and I was a little worried about buying these grey market watches as I was concerned it wasn't legit. If this isn't genuine its an incredible copy! The box and packaging all looked 100% as well.Of course it was missing the manufacturers warranty card, thats why its cheaper than from an authorized dealer.

B000B545EG,5/5,5.0,"I got this watch when Timex came out with the Indiglo series - a long time ago. I've gone through several batteries. Just this week the band broke at the band bars. The replacement band is about $10, and the replacement watch is $38, so I'm just going to get a new watch even though my old watch works perfectly. I just set the compass for the first time, and am impressed how well it works. (I'm embarassed to confess that I didn't know that this watch had a built-in compass until i read the promo material for its replacement. so much for reading owners' manuals!) This is a well-made watch for the price - in fact for any price! I have worn my expedition nightly and on weekends whenever I'm on the boat, working in the garage, remodeling houses, etc., when I didn't want to run the risk of damaging my Seikos. I've gone through three Seikos, but this watch, the one that took the most abuse is still working great.I'll try to clarify a few things about Timex Indiglo watches battery replacement as the reviews indicate some confusion. First, the required CR1620 battery is very inexpensive - I buy the energizer 5-pack (current price on Amazon is $4.26 for the 5-pack). After all these years, I'm still working on my first 5-pack. Second, the battery is trivial to replace if you have a set of jeweler's screwdrivers. (if not, you can get a set of 16 by Fuller on Amazon for $12 - though I'd recommend getting Xcelite or Wiha @ twice the price but they'll last much longer).There are 4 phillips screws on the back of the case. A PH00x60(approx 1/16"") phillips screwdriver works fine. You remove these screws, then pull up on the colored, sticky tab and the battery comes out. Before you pull out the battery, note the position of the arrow on the tab. The arrow points to the reset button. After replacing battery and tab, push the reset button with the screwdriver tip and reassemble. You're done. (hints: perform this operation on a piece of white paper as the screws are *very* small. I use tweezers to align the screws with the holes. don't overtighten. There's an o-ring on the case that provides watertight integrity with the case back and it compresses easily.)Hope this helps.",watch

B0007X9F7E,0/0,5.0,"I've been searching for a thin profile watches, both offline and also online mainly for use in official functions and as casual wear. When I looked at this model the first time, I know it would look good on me - and sure it does. This is the first time I had a mesh band watch and enough said that this is the best thing about this watch - apart from its very thin profile. I have no problem in adjusting the band to my wrist size (by using a solid plastic protractor!) and also no problem in wearing long sleeve shirts/suits. Though the fitting is slightly loose on my rather thin wrist, it still holds tightly thanks to its mesh band construction.The only gripe I had with this model is the date function which is not automatic, i.e it can't differentiate 28/30/31-day month. After the end of a 30-day month, you have to manually wind the crown to reset it to 1, otherwise it'll be 31. I guess this is a problem with most date function in watches at this price range, so I don't have much complain here. I'm just happy that it shows the time perfectly everyday I use. And it does looks good on me, at least that's what I've been told by my colleagues in the office.Another plus point is the availability of a service center nearby my area. Since I'm living in India, it's good to know that this watch is serviceable within the country, although the brand itself is not very well known in this part of the world. Overall, I'm very pleased with it and will definitely buy another Skagen in the near future.On another note, I just hope that in future Amazon consider using either DHL or UPS only when delivering products to India since they have their own branches here and do not depend on local agents. Local couriers here had a rather questionable attitude in servicing customers - they had already missed twice the dateline for my deliveries from Amazon in the past year and never send me any apologies or the like. However, the prompt and efficient solution provided by Amazon's customer service saved my trust in making further purchases.",watch

B0006AAS7E,2/2,5.0,"This Invicta 8932 is a nice watch for those who want something a little more deluxe than the average Casio or Timex watch. I had recently bought a Casio for $21 from Amazon and decided to get a couple more watches that were basically the ""next step up"" on the watch food chain.My first Invicta purchase was theInvicta Men's 9310 Pro Diver Collection Swiss Quartz Watchwhich is a larger Swiss movement quartz-based version, with the blue bezel and silver and gold trim on the watchband. It seemed very well constructed and at the same time I purchased it, I bought a cheap set of watch tools16 PCS Watch Tool Kitfrom Amazon for a little over $7 because I knew I was going to need to remove links from the band. Both the 9310 and the 8932 come with watchbands large enough to fit a retired NFL defensive tackle's wrist. Most guys will need to take out a link or more to get this watch to fit. The watchband resizing tool that comes with many of those cheap watch tool sets will do the job in about 10 minutes, once you get the hang of it. Simply line up the watchband in the slot and adjust it, so that the little hole that contains the pin for the link lines up with the pointy end of the tool and twist the screwdriver-like handle in the direction the arrow on the watchband link is pointing and out it pops! Repeat as necessary and re-insert a pin to join the watchband together and you've saved a trip to the jeweler's shop and a few bucks, in addition to learning a new skill. It's not rocket science!Some people have complained that upon receiving the 8932, it is smaller than they thought it might be. In comparing it to my 9310, the 8932 looks like a 7/8ths scale version. If you want that Rolex Submariner look and heft, you might consider theInvicta Men's 9307 Pro Diver Collection Stainless Steel Watch, which does have that look, at about $35 more than the 8932.Whether you buy the 8932 or the 9307, please remember that they are quartz watches and while they look very waterproof, they probably (from the number of complaints from other reviewers) aren't. If you expect to hold on to this watch as a minimum, until the battery dies (avg. 2-3 yrs, but ymmv!), the only water these watches should ever see would be the picture coming out of your TV set from the Discovery Channel during Shark Week. If you want to do Jacques Cousteau impressions with an Invicta Diver-style watch, you'd be better off with theInvicta Men's 8926 Pro Diver Collection Automatic Watchand its more expensive siblings, which are automatic, but have a screw-down crown, which aids in keeping water out. The downside to automatic watches is that they aren't quite as accurate as quartz watches are. These quartz models do not have screw-down crowns.I'm going to enjoy these ""pretend Rolex look-alikes"" for what they are and hope that when the battery dies in them, that I can easily replace it with the extra fancy watch-back openerWatch Case Opener Wrench Tool For Waterproof Watches CasebackI bought, in addition to the cheap watch tool set.

I'll admit that I bought this one because it was the cheapest base model I could find that didn't contain a variety of features I didn't want or need. If that's the case, I think you'll be quite pleased:Band comfort - this watch is very comfortable to wear in a variety of conditions. It never got cumbersome after hours of wear. If you want something more substantial than the fitted rubber, you might check out Timex's variety of replacement bands here:Timex Men's Q7B799 Resin Ironman Triathlon 30 Lap 16mm Replacement Watchband.Display - Very easy to read.Buttons - Big and easy to locate.Durability of face, bezel - In this watch I actually wanted cheaper. I didn't want to always worry if I scratched this or that part. But it's been no worry as both the face and bezel have shown no scratches. All the text is an inlaid inscription, so it won't rub off.Indiglo - Works great at night. This iteration of watches illuminates the digits themselves, as opposed to the entire background, which can be gentler on the eyes at night.Battery life - Amazingly I've had this watch for four years and it shows no signs of slowing up. Much like my last Ironman did.intuitiveness of use - this is the only part of the watch that I found as needs improvement. I'm not a big manual reader, so maybe it's my fault, but I like to jump in to a product, and I still haven't figured out what things are for. When you press the Start button, it changes the second-hand sweeper to the words T2 and T3 for a few seconds, before going back to the time. Holding Start changes this to T1 and T3 - I don't know what this is for the life of me. Secondly, pressing start among different cycles of the chronogram doesn't restart the timer, but displays different multiples of the same lap time. I don't know what good that is. ""Occasion"" mode asks for a month and date, but I don't know what the purpose of it is. It doesn't currently beep to remind me of anything?Overall, the pros far outweigh the cons.

B00006I5YQ,7/7,4.0,"I got this watch at a PX for about $20. It seems to have gone up in price. I lose or break watches a lot so I need something that isn't too expensive (nothing above $40). I also work out a lot so I need a band that is plastic or something that can be washed off without having to dry it out (and metal just doesn't work). I hate bands that are leather or cloth because they begin to stink after working out in them for a while. I also need something that is tough and I don't like to spend more than a second to see what the time and date is. So analog hand watches are out and so are watches where you have to push a button in order to figure out what the day and month is. I also want a watch that has big characters because I wear glasses and sometims take them off when I workout because they fog up. Finally, it has to have a countdown timer, a chronograph, at least a couple of LOUD alarms, and at least two adjustable time zones because I am in the military and go overseas often. This watch fits all that, plus what really sets it apart is that it is extremely thin compared to most workout watches. That is a bigger advantage than you would think because having a thicker watch gets in the way of ropes and tight spaces. The only draw backs to this watch is that the band has broken on me before, and that it's face isn't more scratch resistant. But for the functionality and price, it's hard to beat.",watch

I was worried when I ordered it, it would be to large (I have smaller wrists) but it looks great and fits perfectly (I had to remove a couple of links ). Can't comment on using it with scuba gear - yet but have had it on a couple times in the shower without any problem.Overall I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS WATCH!",watch
B000FPZ46K,0/0,4.0,"I bought this watch for my fiance and he loves it. It is packed with features, the construction is sturdy and durable, and it looks great! The only complaints would be that the backlight only stays on for about 2 seconds and then goes off..and there's no way to change the duration. Also, the digital time is often difficult to read, first of all because it is very small and secondly because the analog hands often block it. Other than that, great watch!",watch
B00077ALQ4,9/9,5.0,"On the other reviews a few complain that the watch is too big. Others state the Screen is too small. Well I love this watch how it is. It has the core features I have come to rely on in my palm.....right at my wrist. I don't have to remember to take it with me to meetings, etc. Charging it at night is no big deal....I just plug it in next to my cell phone. No complaints. My only request is that the next version be water resistant. What an ingenious product and they had to balance screen size with watch size...doing pretty well I think.",watch

The expensive look of the Seiko watches along with their quality has always always been a drawing card for me. This Seiko has been no exception. The watch does a great job keeping time and having the date on its face is a bonus. The stainless steel band is a plus too. My husband will never have to worry about having an allergic reaction to the metal it is made from, nor have to be concerned about the possibility that his wrist may turn green. The list price of this Seiko is reasonable, but being able to purchase it for 70% off was even better.",watch

Her friends even loved it and thought she was lucky to have a boyfriend to get her such a nice watch, at that point I must say I'm very happy with this. I really wanted her to love it and I think I hit the spot.I'm giving it a 4 not a 5 because I seriously thought that its a bigger watch, I know the dimensions are there but the picture is deceiving... in my opinion they used a macro lens to make it look larger, I know the dimensions are listed but still!! Anyway my gf is quite skinny so that didn't turn out to be a problem, it suited her well. For all you others just be aware of the size, thats my only negative point.",watch

Looks amazing and the overall ruggedness of the watch is fantastic.

Easy to read hands and numbers at night. The leather band is nice and sturdy. I like the placement of the the screwdown crown.

B000FINOT6,1/1,5.0,"This watch exceeded my expectations, especially for the price offered. Workmanship and visual quality are top notch, and all functions and features look and perform as stated by Amazon and the Bulova company. The chronograph second hand does in fact move back and forth ever so slightly when not in function (as mentioned in a previous review) but it is very little movement. The masculine form and build of this watch is confirmed when in hand - it is heavy, thick banded, and sporty. The chronograph feature is easy to operate, but in my opinion it is slightly difficult to read exact time measurements on the graduated dials. The band and clasp are both very secure and feel sturdy. Bezel operation is precise and tight. The iridescent accents on the hands and hour markers are not of high output, so the dial is hard, if not impossible, to read in low light situations. Overall this watch is gorgeous and of high quality, but is not so flashy that it would be out of place for casual or working environments. I would purchase this item again if it were lost, stolen, or broken. Highly recommend.",watch

Automatic watches are usually big and bulky, but this is the smallest and lightest-weight one I've ever had. It looks both casual and dressy at the same time. It's a comfort to know that if I get caught in a downpour, the watch won't be hurt.

The strap looks ""silly"" with the metal eyelets in the strap. That being said the watch is masculine and functional. An excellent value for an eco-drive model. The case is a polished stainless steel which is the opposite of what a military outdoor watch should be. The case would be better served with a non-reflective matte finish. I believe this was a compromise by citizen to make it appeal to those looking for a fashion dress watch.

B0007IR4W2,3/3,5.0,"I recently purchased this watch and I am very happy with it so far. It looks stylish, yet slightly more classic than some of the newer round face eco-drives. I found it to be lighter and less noticable on my wrist than the larger round face chrono's as well. After trying on heavier stainless steel watches the titanium became a must for me. I am a pretty big guy (6'5, 240lbs)but I don't like the feeling of a heavy watch on my wrist.The Largo is unobtrusive yet still masculine.The only drawback is that when switching between the functions you must wait for the watch to cycle back through the clock until it reaches the previous position of each function. This can take a few minutes because it will only travel clockwise while doing this automatically, rather than taking the shortest route.Otherwise I am satisfied.

B000H6AQ0Q,2/2,4.0,"I purchased this watch to use as a stopwatch during my runs. I didn't have anything that was particularly good for working out, and my husband has had his Timex for years with only battery and strap replacements. I found this Timex and figured it would be a good buy, and I was right. I didn't expect much out of it, given the price, but it really has exceeded my expectations.The functions are a little different than most typical digital watches (e.g., the Indiglo button is the bottom right, whereas every other digital watch I've seen, including my husband's Timex, is the top left button), but that doesn't take that long to get used to unless you're switching between watches often.The strap material is good because it doesn't chafe, and it doesn't get particularly sweaty or sticky like some plastics. It stays in place, more or less, unless I move it. I don't find it the least bit annoying to wear on my wrist while running, which says a lot, since my metal watches for everyday (non-exercise) wear annoy me if they aren't loose like a bracelet.I have been wearing this watch for 3+ months now, and I run or Spin 6 days/week (mostly running - only 1 day/week is Spinning). I have run in high humidity, in the cold, in fog, and in the rain. I have had zero issues with moisture in the watch or malfunctions of any kind. I definitely don't swim or shower with it, but it's gotten pretty decently wet in the rain and has not skipped a beat, so to speak.My only complaint is that at 30 minutes the appearance changes so that the minute reading is big, but the seconds are small. This can be annoying to try to read while you're running, but you get used to it. I'm not sure why they did that (there's certainly enough room for ""30:01"" on the face), since the changeover could have certainly occurred at one hour rather than 30 minutes, but at this price it's hard to get too upset about it.All in all a good value because I wasn't expecting this watch to do much more than act as a reliable stopwatch. Oh, and the colors are nice, too. Not too masculine, but not too feminine, either. Very sporty-looking.",watch

The blue hands are a nice touch, where silver or white, or even black would get lost in the detail of the watch, the blue really stands out without being gaudy. The automatic winding mechanism and all the machinework is beautifully exposed through both the crystal and the clear watch back.There are 2 things that keep this from being a 5-star review. 1) the band isn't particularly comfortable. It's overly stiff and the loop that holds the loose end of the band rubs on my wrist at times. 2) the crystal has cristp black lettering that says ""Stuhrling Original"" but it's not perfectly centered on the 12, it looks like the crystal was put on just slightly rotated from center.

Begin able to turn on the watch with the flick of your wrist without needing both hands helps me keep stride.The numbers are large and the controls are intuitive. The indiglo shows through the numbers instead of on top of face so the contrast between the numbers and the surrounding area is high.

What the heck is wrong with product development in watches? (Or what the heck is wrong with search on Amazon?) I came up with this one, read the reviews, and thought I would give it a try. You can just about ONLY see this face when the light is on. Don't get me wrong, the light is great, but you shouldn't have to turn it on to clearly see the numbers. And the supposed date on the watch might as well be a spot of dust. Absolutely useless. Furthermore, the band is too restrictive, and doesn't come with extra links. It pinches. I want a band that she can put on herself with one hand. A normal watch band with the tiny clasp is too difficult to put on when you live alone and have a hard time seeing. This is the downside of buying online instead of going to a store and seeing the product. I never would have purchased this in a store.

For a 3rd comparison, I went to Macy's and the band from Macy's is the same one as from Amazon. So, either the Jewelry store one is different, or the band style has changed form the manufacturer.

B00074KYC8,0/0,5.0,"There are two reasons one might buy this watch, for the highly readable white on black watch face or the usable aviator's sliderule. I must admit, I bought it for the sliderule, not so much to use, but as a novelty. (Kinda like the moon phase dial on my other Citizen Ecodrive watch.) Regardless of the reason chosen, this watch matches both expectations.First off, it is strikingly handsome. The high contrast white on black format makes it highly readable, even in the dark. I must admit that the sliderule font size is pretty small for my old eyes, but on a bright day, it is quite visible and usable. And unless the watch was made 50% larger, the scale wouldn't fit, so it is what it needs to be. About the only complaint I would have is that the slide rule conrol knob is in the 8:00 o'clock position, which would be nicely suited for a left-handed person. But the dial turns so nicely that I can roll it knob with the edge of my thumb, so that is fine, too. The 24 hour clock function is another novelty. (I can pretty easily add 12 to the displayed time in the afternoon.) But it is also quite readable, does not clutter up the display area, and is a nice check on my mental math.I should warn you. The watch is a little thicker than I anticipated. Of course, the dimensions are clearly stated on the description, but I did not read that. So if your arm is quite thin, you may not like that. But I have a thick wrist, so it matches up perfectly.So far, the watch works just as expected. The Eco-drive approach is great, as I learned on my other watch. No batteries to change, no winding, and it even runs for weeks in the dark once it gets fully charged.",watch

B000EQR6H0,0/0,4.0,"I use this as my everyday watch. I purchased a separate brown leather strap to dress it up a bit, but the strap it comes with isn't bad at all. The watch has a sporty feel to it. When dressed up with a nicer band, this watch fits in perfectly with watches a few hundred dollars more in price (Looking at you Tissot). When I go fishing or camping, I put the original band on and this is a great outdoors watch as well. Being powered by light, I've never had to reset; something that drives me nuts with the Rolex (kinetic) I wear only for special occasions. Numbers and hands glow in the dark, which is a bit tacky, but useful at night. Face and casing are good, not great, in terms of scratch resistance. Again, not a watch you'll wear to your wedding, but great for every day use and something you won't lose sleep over if ever lost or stolen.",watch

B000EI646M,1/1,5.0,"I have been watch shopping for about 6 months now, being as I lost my beloved Oniss. I had been looking at Tag Heuer's but didn't want to spend $1000 on a watch my children could get a hold of..So my after seeing this lovely Bulova, which was similar looking to my Oniss. So I thought well $69.00 what a deal, I will get this and hope that the band is not too small.This was delivered in 2 days (via Amazon Prime is so worth it), nicely boxed with instructions. First impression: was wow this is so much nicer than I was anticipating. This watch feels great on, extremely light weight and sleek design, definite daily wearer, both business and casual. Now I am a mom to two young ones, and an Insurance Agent. So when I say business, I mean nice enough to wear to a client meeting.Now I don't have a great measuring tape (sewing tape), but here is what I came up with:More than ample 8 1/2 band length delivered, 1/2 band width, a bit less that 1/4 inch watch thickness, band is more like 1/8 inch thickness.Great looking!Inexpensive!Extremely comfortable!Decent Brand Name!I will update this review as to performance and durability as needed.UPDATE: 06/02/07 I still love this watch, however, today when I took it out of my drawer, it had stopped working yesterday evening? This is the 2nd time this has happened..I wonder if it sits dormant for a period of time it requires being reset? I don't know, however I have reset it and we will see if it keeps working..",watch
B000IZAWB4,3/3,4.0,"this watch is gorgeous. my mom has been looking at it for years and finally told me she wanted it but didn't want to spend the money on it, so I bought it for her for christmas and she loved it! the only issue that I have with it is that to adjust the wristband, you have to move this little pin which is kind of difficult and then put it back before you can close the clasp. It felt like it was going to break when we were pushing it back down, but maybe we just didn't do it right. The face is the best part of this watch, along with the rose colored gold band. Enjoy!",watch
B000FPZ456,21/21,5.0,"Casio Men's G-Shock Atomic Solar Watch #GW700A-9VWith so many fine Casio choices, and after reading numerous reviews of all the Casio Atomic Solar and Pathfinder watches, it was difficult to come down to a final decision. I had originally thought I would get a Pathfinder model, but the significantly higher cost and likely bulkier size steered me to the G-Shock models, and I could not be more pleased.Since this is, after all, a watch, the most important feature to me was accuracy. Casio's website (http://www.casio.com/products/Timepiece/G-Shock/GW700_Series/product/GW700A-9V/)indicates +/-15 seconds per month. I think that is probably conservative, but certainly acceptable, even without Atomic Timekeeping. Based on my relative short term use, I'm guessing it will probably end up being closer to 5 seconds per month, again without atomic updating.Atomic Timekeeping:In viewing many of the Casio watches which have this feature, the reviews seemed to be mixed, with a significant number saying the feature (or lack thereof) was very disappointing. Living in Mayberry (Mount Airy, NC,) a pretty good distance from Fort Collins, I had to assume that I would probably not be able to get the signal. So did I still want the watch, at a price that certainly included such a sophisticated feature ? Sure, why not. I could always return it.The first night after I got the watch, I followed the directions and placed it in a window, facing southwest, which was the best that I could do. And wonder of all wonders, the next morning it had synced with the radio signal!! Notice the small circular dial on the lower right corner of the watch face. That now has the letter ""G"" in the circle, indicating a strong signal was received. Pressing the receive button in the lower right corner shows the time of the sync. The next night, I left the watch on the night table next to my bed. Again a successful sync. The next night, I left it in another room on a bedside table, not near a window. Again, the sync was successful. I kept the watch ""stand"" that came with the watch. It seems just right for synching purposes.Solar Power:Casio says this watch has ""Tough Solar Power."" I'm not sure how that differs from regular solar power, but when I got the watch, it was already set to the proper time, day of the week, and date. The small solar strength arrow on the left side of the watch face indicated that the battery had a ""middle charge."" I placed the watch face up under an incandescent lamp for a couple of hours. The arrow moved up to ""high"" and has stayed there since.Watch face:The picture of the watch face is accurate except that the day of the week and date and month are actually darker than in the picture. There is plenty of contrast in normal lighting, and a brief touch of the ""G"" button below the watch face on the band quickly lightens the screen. The regular time screen shows exactly what I wanted: time, day of week, date, battery level. Other options are shown in the upper left and right of the watch face.Watch band:The resin band is very comfortable and has 12 holes for adjustment. I am slender and the 4th hole down from the watch is just the right size for me. So it has plenty of slots for expansion, especially in the larger direction.Watch size and weight:Even on my wirey arms, the watch is not too large, nor too heavy. In fact it is smaller than my old Timex Ironman, but heavier. The casio specs say it weighs slightly less than 2.4 onces. I weighed mine on a set of postal scales and it came out at just short of 2.6 onces. Again, not an issue.I have not tested the other features of the watch, but I do not expect any surprises.All in all this is the best watch I have ever owned, solidly built, and with the major features that I wanted, all of which perform flawlessly.",watch

B0009J5O7G,2/2,5.0,This is a very handsome watch with a classic face and an attractive and sturdy leather band. It certainly qualifies as a dress watch but would not look out of place for causual wear. I have only lost the signal once in the two weeks I have owned it and was able to reacquire the signal in less than two minutes. It is a little thick so guys using the second button on their shirt cuffs may find it difficult to slide their cuff over the watch. I'm extremely happy with the product so far. The only downside is that folks at work are constantly asking me for the time.,watch

B000H28USA,0/0,5.0,"I bought this watch through Amazon for my husband for a special birthday gift, and it's absolutely lovely without being gaudy or excessively showy. (He has decided, however, to wear it only for special occasions.) Still, it is simply stunning and lovely - even on this compact macho guy. This is good since he is the type that would not wish to wear a watch he considered feminine looking. Also, it is not a 'huge piece,' but a rather compact display. The diamonds are clearly sparkling and profuse, but their cut is flat-topped, so it's a bit more subtle. And the band is gorgeous with a more polished stainless steel look. At this stage, the only drawback seems to be that it lacks the mini-adjuster at the latch point on the band back - the one which permits a pin to be moved back and forth 1-2 millimeters for each of 2-4 holes. This means, in hubby's case, it feels too lose or too tight. So he says. If you, on the other hand, can live with link-removal differences, and are not a huge man, this may be your diamond watch.",watch

I knew the G-Shocks were popular and trendy, and I wanted a basic model of it.Glad I got this one. It is very simple as far as features and its looks, but it has a stopwatch, an alarm feature, and a timer feature. The light is a nice feature as well. For the pricepoint, I think this is an excellent buy.",watch
B000EQS1JW,1/1,5.0,"This is a great watch that goes anywhere. It looks better than in the pictures. It's totally un-fancy and un-fussy, simple to read, and feels high-quality. I like the day-date calendar, and I love that a short time in bright light each day keeps the battery topped off. The numbers and hands glow in a cool blue color in the dark, and although they're not particularly bright they're very easy to read. I do wish the glow lasted a bit longer.As other reviewers have noted, the canvas strap is quite stiff and uncomfortable at first, but I'd say that disappears in less than a week and it's totally fine now. It looks like a nicely-made strap, with the stitching and metal grommets around the buckle holes. About the only thing that bugs me about the strap is it's very green. Most of the photos I've seen seem to show it as more brownish than it really is. It seems to clash with most of the stuff I wear. Not a big deal and of course you can always change the strap.The only other (minor) gripe I have is that the crown does not screw down, and when it's pushed in it just rotates freely. A few of my other watches have screw-down crowns, which I prefer. Then again, this one does have a 100m water resistance, which is fine for day-to-day stuff like rain, dishwashing, and swimming. You're not going to dive with this watch, but then again if you're doing to dive you probably have a different watch for that.Overall, I love it.",watch

I will concede I have small wrists, so they may not be appropriate for anyone who has a large wrist, but they are terrific bargains given how well they work, and the cost. Love Love Love.

B000GB0G7A,0/0,4.0,"This is a nice and simple watch that keeps time accurately as far as I can tell. The instructions say plus or minus 20 seconds per month. It doesn't look fancy, but it doesn't look gaudy or tacky either - it has a very neutral style I think. The watch isn't too big, considering that I have a very small wrist but the watch doesn't look too large when I wear it.Unfortunately, after a few days of using the watch, somehow the front protective glass got noticeably scratched. I don't know how or when, although it could have happened when I was lifting some heavy objects and something might have caught the watch on my wrist. Now the watch doesn't look so snazzy. I feel like it may have gotten scratched easier than other watches would, since I have owned many other watches of similar niceness in the past without having them scratch so readily. Right now I'm considering buying another one, though, and ""watching"" it more closely to see that it doesn't take damage.So, I would say this a good watch for a simple, low-priced neutral timekeeping style as long as it's treated gently. All things considered, this watch is indeed a good value.",watch

It is probably about as close to the perfect size that you could ask for. Watch isn't terribly heavy, but feels and looks sturdily built. Should last me many years with the proper care. The price for this watch is really quite amazing when you consider that it cost this much or more many years ago. Can't see where they have cut corners to keep the price artificially low. Seiko reminds me a lot of Honda or Toyota -- a great deal of pride in their products. AND IT SHOWS! One of those far-too-infrequent occasions where you actually get what you pay for.

B00068TJIU,1/1,4.0,"This is an attractive watch. It keeps good time, without losing seconds over a period of days. It's an automatic, meaning it does not use a battery, and I've found I can go a day or more and it will still work.It's luminous dials are very bright for several hours -- mine is still new and this will probably fade after a few years. The luminocity is one of the keys to a good dive watch, and from reading other reviews, seems to be important to people.The case, bezel and crystal are all rugged and sturdy. I've already brushed up against doorways, washed the dog, and other activities with it on and it still looks new. Not even a scratch on the bezel markings, and that's rare for me. Most of the time I've got a scratch on the outside of the case or the bezel of a watch within 48 hours.The second hand is very precise in its movements, and it truly sweeps around the the dail. Some people don't like this. It's sort of like an electric wall clock of the type many schools and government offices have used over the past 50 years. I like the second hand to move fluidly and not ""click"" past the numbers. So this is a benefit to me. I've had other Seiko watches over the past 20 years or so and this seems to be the case with those as well.Those are the pros.Here are the cons:The bracelet is like chain mail. It has little interlocking pieces in the center and where it attaches to the lugs making it flex back and forth. When I take it off, because the bracelet flexes side-to-side, I'm afraid the bracelet is going to twist off. I've had this kind of watch bracelet before and, after time, it will bend away from the lugs. Not good. I will probably purchase a stainless steel Rolex type bracelet or a NATO nylon strap for it soon.The bezel is to big. It's not ""rounded"" down on the outside, which gives the watch too high a profile, in my opinion. This probably has to do with not wanting to upset Rolex or Omega or with Seiko wanting to not look like a knock-off watch company. Whatever the reason, I don't like the high profile look on my arm.To recap: It's a good timepiece and sturdy, but the bracelet is kind of whimpy and the bezel pokes out. If you wear it just for diving it'll be fine. It's not a good ""everyday"" watch however, and probably isn't made for that to begin with.",watch
B0007VMWCQ,1/2,5.0,"I was looking for a simple, classic looking field watch and my budget was pretty low. This watch fits those requirements perfectly! It tells the time without looking flashy or bothersome. It's the perfect size: Large enough to be a mens watch and small enough to be comfortable. The 3 straps included are a bit short however. My wrists are rather small yet I use a hole closer to the end than the middle of the strap. The straps seem very durable though, and length isn't much of an issue really. The price is unbeatable for all that you get and if the watch ever breaks I'll still have three straps and some spare pins for my next watch. For a %20 watch, I'll give it 5 stars.",watch
B0000YBMM6,0/0,5.0,"I wanted a watch with lots of brown in it for something different to wear, rather than a silver or black watch. This one fit the bill, having brown even on the dial, which is rare. It's nicer than it looks in the picture, which I thought was the case based on another pic I saw on another site.The watch itself is actually fairly thick, comes in a nice box, lifetime warranty. The band is thick, wide and sturdy also. You can hardly read the date because it's so small, but I don't like date windows on watches anyway, so I'm kinda glad it's so small. The time is easy to read because of the contrast on the face. Some watches need a fair amount of lighting to see the hands; not this one.I shopped a long time for this watch; you can't beat it for the money. Even though Amazon didn't ship directly, it got here in under 4 business days from the time I ordered. Another great Amazon purchase!",watch
B000KI7GWM,0/0,2.0,"I had previously purchased this unit for less than $100 - it appears price has gone up significantly. I bought this hoping to be able to use it for my Hamilton X-Wind automatic - unfortunately, I had to return it. The unit itself is pretty handsome, however, workmanship of the leather just seemed okay. There was a minor scratch in the leather edging that was covered by the hinged cover. The primary reason that I returned it however is because the unit I received appeared to be defective - the motor would not operate when I installed a fresh set of batteries. It worked fine with the supplied AC adapter... and ran pretty quiet with this power source. I wanted to have the option to use batteries for when I traveled. I opted to return the unit as opposed to trying to get it replaced.",watch
B00068TJNK,0/0,5.0,"This watch is a must buy if you like a solid, grand but not too showy watch that offers functions other than simply telling the time, or at least not a plain boring dial. It blends from office wear to casual clothes seamlessly. The gold color is even better than the picture, I think even nicer than Rolex gold color. The middle section of the watch chains are glossy gold, and the sides are matt gold. I took out 3 chain sections. The length of the watch chains should be able to be adjusted to fit all. The combination of black dial and gold details is very grand, striking and cool. The glass is concave shaped, which makes it look very pleasant as it gives depth to it and makes it shine instead of dull and flat glass like many other watches. The back of the watch is stainless steel silver plate that says water resistant up to 20 bar. The chronograph buttons have lock functions to prevent accidental push.My fiance initially did not like the look of the watch from the Amazon main picture as she was afraid that it would be too bling, but she was very impressed when she saw the actual watch and held it in her hands. I live in Singapore, and I received the item within 1.5 days! I ordered on Mon night, and received on Wed morning! The parcel came from a Chinatown shop in Singapore, hence I believe that the merchant in Amazon is some kind of distributor. It will ask the retail shops nearest to your home to send the watch to you. Plus with Amazon, Very Efficient! It came in an egg-shaped plastic box with 2 manuals: 1 for the watch, and 1 for the slider rule functions. I tried to set the alarm based on the watch manual and it is not easy. I haven't tried the slide rule, but I don't think I'll be using the functions anyway. I still can't believe that this watch comes at this low price!",watch

B000GB1R5U,3/3,2.0,"This is an EDIT to the review of my OLD Casio (below) that I recently decided to retire. Unfortunately after only 3 months, the ANALOG portion of the NEW CASIO AMW320R-1EV has been losing time. Only a couple of minutes at first, and then last evening 20 minutes. The DIGITAL portion keeps perfect time, so the problem's something to do with the portion that translates the electronic time to the mechanical movement that moves the hands. I did some online research, and this is apparently a COMMON problem, with people reporting that even after sending $15 to return their watch under warranty(and have sent back), the problem re-appears a few months later. One poster said he' had THREE fail the same way so far. I am now wearing my 20 year old Casio again, and while it gains a minute (digital and analog) every several weeks, at least it's reliable. I edited my ""5 STAR"" rating (true for my OLD Casio) down to TWO for this one, and can no longer recommend it.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I've owned mine for almost 20 years now, and used it to ""replace"" a Bulova Accutron Astronaut model I'd had since 1965, but which at over $1000 collector value has gotten too expensive for me to wear ""comfortably.""The Casio has been flawless, and while the flexible band won't last forever, it can easily be replaced by the Casio stainless brand one made for this model (wide), or a generic as I used on mine. I wore mine in my job as an airline pilot, so the watch was exposed to years of exceptionally dry air in the pressurized cabin, which was probably hard on the vinyl band, I think, though I much prefer the stainless one I installed anyway.Just recently the 20 yr old watch watch has started gaining about a minute every several weeks, and the stop watch portion is now intermittent, so I've decided to buy a replacement. I paid about $35 for my first one, and at $47, it seems a bargain still.I sure can't complain much, and my sole complaint, if you can call it that, is that the luminous hands are not terrible long lived.I also wish the face on the current model were exactly like the old one (9, 12, and 3 o'clock were large, bold numbers, digital window was curved, and the hands were a tad longer), but few things in life stay exactly the same forever.",watch

How wrong I was.After less than a year I cracked the crystal by setting the watch on a plastic countertop. Apparently they are not made to handle impact of any kind. Navy Seals must be a fragile bunch.After considerable hassle, the Luminox service center repaired the watch, but charged me an outragous $120 dollars - and it took them all of 16 weeks.Several months later the glow-in-the-dark paint fell off of the second hand and now sits inside the watch housing, getting pushed around by the hands.I like the look of this watch, but the quality is terrible.

No box or instructions though.This is a nice watch, but nowhere near as nice as my Tag or Rolex.Two things that could make this watch better are the following:1. Screw down dial.2. Rotating bezel with better tolerances. The bezel has a bit of slop and can only be rotated smoothly using two fingers. My two fingers still slip though, because the grip is not good.It's nice to have a digital watch now with alarm and hourly chime.

My Dad immediately loved it & mentioned how much he liked the blue face dial. He is in his 70's & has never had a nice watch like this. I like it because I think it is very versatile. I think it could be used as a casual watch as well as a dressy watch. I think that is the sign of a classic design. FYI-It has a darker silver look to it, not like a typical stainless steel. It is polished but just has a slightly darker color to the band. I like this because it makes the watch look different, not the run of the mill that everyone has. I also like the way the hands & hours glow at night to make it easier to read in the dark. This is also something that my Dad never had in a watch & he likes it.

B00070QHAU,31/35,2.0,"Being a traveller who frequently sleeps in noisy hotels with inconsiderate neighbours (sound proofing of doors not exactly being high priority in even the best of most hotels...), I thought a vibrating watch would be a really neat way to sleep with ear plugs and yet be woken up by an alarm.This watch is small and light which fits my bill for being portable and easy to travel with. I also like the dual clock (since I am often in a time zone separate from those I might call).As a reminder alarm it would probably work fine. The two audible alarms are very discrete with the barest of audible 'peeps' as the audible alarm goes off. In fact it is the most pathetic peep I've heard next to a Suunto watch - an airconditioner's quite hiss would be enough to render this peep inaudible! The vibration is sufficent to alert you that an alarm has gone off, though I am sure some people will hear the 'zzzffth' sound it makes as it vibrates against you (yep, louder than the peep...).But I'm relieved to say it wakes me up when I'm sleeping with ear plugs. I was at first very apprehensive about the vibration - didn't think it would be sufficient. Then I spent weeks travelling and my body was so out of whack I was frequently awake before the alarm went off. But now after several months, my backup alarm clock has been deemed unnecessary - the vibration from the watch seems to be sufficient to jar me from my slumber.I would probably recommend that if you are going to use this watch to wake up, then set the 2nd alarm as a 'snooze' alarm because it only vibrates for 20 seconds and in a very deep slumber, that only seems to bring you around - the second alarm maybe necessary to wake up completely. But I can be a very deep sleeper and I have not yet failed to be woken by the vibration on my wrist.I do also agree with one reviewer that it is very easy to accidently turn the alarm off... I do end up checking in a parnoid manner as I go to bed that I didn't accidently turn the alarm off if I touched a button - because the next alarm mode after vibrate is off!The watchband will defintely be an issue for anyone with slim wrists as well. Yes, I am female and this is a male watch, but I am on the last notch of the band and it still feels loose. I wouldn't even consider this watch for a child... I would also say for the price you pay, the watch band is a little cheap.So for discretion and reminders, this watch is exceptional. For the purpose I bought it for - as an alarm to wake up with, its turning out to be not to bad, and if lucky, the manufacturers will one day remedy some of these issues.",watch

B000GAYQM2,4/4,4.0,"Ok, don't be misled by the title. That probably explains my anguish. I saw this watch like an year ago. Fell in love with it the minute I laid my eyes on it. Took me an year or more to buy it. But when I finally bought it, it was mixed feelings.I was worried as I heard people mention it might not look the same as in the site, but it was pretty much same. I was floored by the quality and the build. Sturdy and pretty sophisticated looking.Features aplenty, surprisingly though missing few Casio features like waveceptor and the like, but for $50 you couldn't ask for more.Manual is easy to understand but not to read. Functions will take some time to work with, I still can't figure out the alarm On/Off setting, but that's just me.Problem I observed at the very beginning is that the light function is really really bad. It lasts for 2-3 seconds, hardly much if you want to change settings or modes. Light reminds of those days when it was just meant to show time. But the watch has more than that for the illuminator to work for such a less time. I am mightily disappointed with that.Other than that, the usual suspects as others mentioned, are there, but the annoyance factor varies from person to person. I am pretty much fine with it.In hindsight, there is a similar model with lighter background and I think I should have bought it.But make no mistake, the watch is a really good one for its price.

B000P0VCDY,6/6,5.0,"I love this watch.Here's a few things you need to know about me:1. I'm a weebit OCPD and I obsess over time. Wearing a digital watch synced up with my computer time exactly is a comfort to me. I've worn a watch since I was 7 and my husband can attest he has never seen me without my trusty digital wrist watch.2. I abuse my watches. I sleep, eat, drink, shower, run, swim, go to the beach, etc with my watches. All my watches end up with scratched surfaces. An unlucky few had their faces broken into. A lot of my watchbands couldn't stand the abuse and committed suicide.3. I lose/break watches like it's my job. By the time I was 22, I have gone through 13 watches. The fastest record of me losing or breaking a watch was 1 hour. No watch has ever lived more than 2 years on my wrist...until now.Now, here's the review:My coworker told me Ironman watches are indestructible, so I had to give it a try. When my watch inevitably died, I gave T5D601 a try. Well, that was a good watch, but the watch band design was flawed. Where the watch band connects to the watch was glued on, and it eventually failed. The watch lasted a year. When my watches die, I normally go into panic mode and head straight to a store where I think they might sell watches to buy a replacement watch. This time, I dragged my poor husband (then boyfriend) who was on a date with me at the time to a store to buy my trusty Ironman watch against his will. I NEEDED it! Life was not complete without my watch! I wasn't going to buy another watch where the watch band was glued on, so after some debating I ended up with this model. It looked sturdy and indestructible. It looked like it might last. I was right.That was four years ago. This is the only watch I've ever had that lasted over two years. It's still alive. Two years ago the pink face plate fell off. I superglued it back on and it has never been a problem since. The pink color is painted on, and a lot of it peeled off over time. Fortunately the plastic underneath has also been dyed a pink color, so it's not obvious that the paint peeled off. The face has six scratches, two of them deep, but the watch is still functional. The band shows no sign of deterioration except for the horrendous scratch marks I caused, which is remarkable.Function:In terms of function, it has three alarms, the normal stuff, I wish it has a count down, but it doesn't. Any function you don't need you can hide. I run, but since I have a Garmin 305, I never used the lap function on this watch. It allows you to set two time zones, and all you have to do is to long press the start button to change time zone permanently. If you want to just see what the other place's time is, just press start button and not hold it down. This function comes in handy for me. I actually use it for daylight savings time.This watch has been to hell and back with me and it is still alive. Four years is an amazing record for me. IMO, it's not the prettiest looking watch out there. My husband tried to buy me a Citizen Eco-Drive to get me away from this hideous watch (his opinion) but I would have none of it.

B000FPVUHM,2/2,4.0,I really like this watch. I was looking for something sporty that could also look nice! This watch fits the bill on both counts. I am outside a lot and I have four horses so the watch takes some hits. It still looks brand new and there is no scratches on it. I am also a single mom to a four month old and the watch is also no worse for the wear from the neverending supply of drool!! The stopwatch and timer are really nice and I do a lot of traveling and will be in Europe for five months this fall and winter so the twenty four hour time will come in handy to coordinate with the train schedules. The time zone feature is great. Overall I am happy with the watch and the look of the watch. The customer service was good...no problems. The only issue I have is with the clasp. A lot of the time something sticks in there and I have a hard time opening the clasp. Not sure what that is all about. That is not enough for me to be unhappy with the watch though...would reccomend this watch to a friend...for sure.,watch

What impressed me the most was that I didn't even have to calibrate it as recommended.What was not so nice was that after 10 month of intensive usage (including alarm and night light on to remind ourselves to feed the newlyborn) the battery gave out. We went in to two nearby jewellers to have the battery replaced. Helaas, they couldn't do it because the battery replacement process was too hard. I listed it on eBay for parts then.",watch

However, this model was off by some millimeters. OK, so maybe that's not much but my quality expectations were high comparing it to my first kinetic watch model.I don't know if that was an acceptable tolerance for SEIKO as far as quality was concerned but nonetheless ""it burst my bubble.""Overall though, it's style, ability to set itself for the proper time when it has been dormant and no need for battery, makes this watch a ""keeper.""",watch

The band is just like the picture.As for the oddball instructions cited by the other writer, the only thing I noted like that applied to a date function which was obviously inapplicable to this watch. There was nothing in my instructions that made me at all hesitant to wind it, either manually or by the self wind function. I wound it and it started going just like it should. I have not yet had the time to test its accuracy.This is no costume piece. It is large (but not too large) and heavy. It comes with a manufacturer's warranty, and it is beautifully and carefully packaged. It might be hard to read in some lighting because of glare, but the hands and numbers are large and easily read if there is no glare.

I have the now-discontinued all-stainless steel version (the discontinued model also has unidirectional rotating bezel, but about $350 less than one with diamonds on the bezel). It is a handsome watch that can be worn during office meetings or for evening affairs. The watch has the accurate Accutron quartz movement and an eye-catching chronograph feature. It is water-resistance rated for 100 meters/330 feet (swimming pools or snorkeling pose no problem. And though the boat I was on in Thailand's Floating Market did not flip over, this Accutron would have handled the dunk, too). Lastly, adjusting for different time-zones is easier with a feature to only move the hour-hand (while the minute-hand remains fixed 'in place').

The titanium makes it very light;sometimes I even forget it's on,and forget to take it off at night. It keeps absolutely perfect time. I found the instructions regarding setting the time and date to be a bit confusing (especially the date),but surmountable.

B000AQVS78,0/0,5.0,"I originally purchased a G-Shock watch for my husband 8-9 years ago. Because it has a Sapphire crystal lens, it does NOT scratch! We have spent a lot of money on other more expensive name brand watches and I have to say, NONE of them came close to holding up to the day to day wear as the G-Shock! We finally broke down and purchased a new one because the pins on the watch band of the original watch kept popping out. We have since learned from our Jeweler the reason for this is because the watch was too loose on my husbands arm and over time, it makes the pin holes larger because of all the movement; shame on us! Regardless, we love the new G-Shock watch too!

It's a BEAUTIFUL watch with a lightweight, secure, stainless steel band and the detail on the dial is terrific.

B000RNNHV4,0/0,3.0,"*Updated*To those of you with questions about accuracy, the watch began to lose about 3 minutes a day recently, and hasn't improved. I've had it now for about 3 months.More importantly, pulling out the watch stem no longer allows me to set the time, so the accuracy loss is a real problem. I will be sending the watch in for repair to have this issue addressed, but do not feel that I should be having to do this after owning it for such a short time, so I have lowered my rating from 5 stars to 3.Be aware that the vendor charges a flat shipping/handling fee of $20 for any watch returned for service (in addition to your costs for shipping it to them in the first place.)I will update this review again with details of my repair transaction.*Original Review follows*The detailing and craftsmanship are stunning, and invite comments and admiration whenever someone happens to see it. I've worn the watch off and on for about a week now, and it has kept perfect time. The manufacturer states that it has a 36 hour power reserve when fully wound, but I have been able to leave it in it's case for two days without it running completely down. As mentioned in previous posts, the leather band was a little stiff when I first took it out of the box, but it quickly softened with wear.Overall, I would definitely recommend this timepiece to anyone who would like a stylish and reliable watch.",watch

It was very cheap and the illumination was very poor. I then bought a Traser from LA Police Gear, and was very happy with it. If you want the badest of the bad, check out the German KHS with the blue tritium...very cool. Best price-to-performance goes to the Traser watches, hands down.

I compared lots of different models (700, 800, 530, 2800, 500, 810, etc. etc.), and eventually selected the GW700A-1V because it offered, IMO, the best combination of the following features that were important to me:1. atomic time synch2. resin band3. reasonable size/bulk (some of the g-shocks can look like small appliances strapped to your arm...)4. buttons that were fairly easy to press5. good display size (I admit, my close-up vision is not what it once was, and some G-shocks have small, cramped displays. Note that the ""font"" size on this watch is not huge by any means, but it seemed larger than many other G-shock models.)6. uncluttered display (this model only has one space-wasting dial vs. 3 or more on other models).So far, I like the watch a lot (only had it a week, though). It synchs every night without issue to the Ft. Collins time signal (since I live in CO this is probably not a huge surprise). It looks good, and has all the features I need. As others have noted, the volume on the alarm is not very loud, so if you are a deep sleeper and plan to use this as your alarm clock, you might want to keep looking.I am a bit skeptical of the solar battery, but time will tell. No issues so far. I looked for a G-shock model that had the atomic time synch and a conventional non-solar battery, but I don't think that combination exists.And definitely purchase this watch on-line... it was around $130 in the dept stores and can be found for much less on line.",watch
B000PSQXWG,0/0,2.0,"Nice looking watch,which is why I ordered it as a gift for myself, so I give it 2 start for the looks. If you're going for the larger sized watch look, this one will catch the eye and the classic color scheme makes it easy to wear with various wardrobes.The face and functionality of this watch was just so poorly thought out for the following reason:- The buttons on the right are simply for the chronograph/stopwatch, which ticks along in 1 second increments only.- The leftmost face is the minute hand for the stopwatch function mentioned above. About the size of a watch battery, the face breaks down your stop watch time in 5 minute increments. Additionally, it's easily hidden behind either the hour hand or the minute hand depending on what time it is. Fairly impractical.- The face in the bottom center is the second hand for the actual time. Would have been much better to have used the large red second hand incorporated with the Chronograph for this function.- The 3rd face on this watch is even more WTF?! It's essentially an hour hand for what time of day it is. It's broken down into 2 hour segments. Seriously Nautica, if I am looking at your watch for the time, I am not looking at the thing about the size of a pea and trying to guess which hour it is, I'm going to looking at the big arms to tell me what time it is.As noted above, it's a good looking watch. If you want something with a good price that looks flashy, consider it. If you want something with a good price, flashy, and well thought out, keep searching.",watch
B00093CZVA,0/0,4.0,"I wanted a watch which could record split and lap times for my running.

The watch arrived within a week of placing the order, which is very good considering I am in Sydney, Australia. I am very pleased with the watch. It is lightweight and comfortable to wear, and it is easy to record a series of split times when I am running. It does everything I want and was not expensive. I can recommend this watch.",watch

B0009P679O,4/4,5.0,"First of all Amazon managed to ship this item to me in two days using their free super saver shipping option. Second the watch actually shipped was not the Invicta 9937 shown above, but rather the much sort after Invicta 9937RI featuring the coin edge Rolex style bezel.In a nut shell this baby is perfect in every detail, from the quality and feel of the watch to the accuracy of the ETA 2842-2 Swiss movement. The magnifier well positioned and actually works! The crystal used on the 9937 is synthetic sapphire and is one of the big perks of the watch, since in all reality it can only be scratched by a diamond.In summary if you want a well made diving watch and can't afford the $4800 for the Rolex then have no hesitation in buying Invicta's 9937 model.",watch

Amazons price was the best I found as well.Now I have had the watch for 6 months. It is accurate and still looks great.

First, the clasp on the watch broke without any significant impact. What's frustrating is that I won't send it back because the warranty requires additional shipping and handling charges for this defective part. Another concern is that the watch does run fast (about 5 minutes per week or two). I have had to reset it frequently and cannot use it for work because it is not consistently accurate. Lastly, you must wear it daily or the watch will stop fairly quickly. Overall, it has not lived up to what I expected and I am very dissappointed in the warranty coverage.

I waited, hoping the watch would cure itself. It didn't. I tried to charge it. It didn't help. I read that some people take out the battery to reset it. After a few months of having a blank screen I opened the watch. Messing with the battery looked like too much of a job. So, I closed up the watch and put it on the charger. Nothing, again. I stick the watch in a drawer for a couple months. I put it on the charger. Nothing. I put in the drawer for another few months. I notice from my credit card bill that I am now getting charged $10 a month for the ""service."" Before cancelling the service. It put the watch on the charger and amazingly enough it started charging. The first charge and use was wierd, but after the second recharge it began acting normally. Well, it has now been about six weeks and it seems to be working fine. And I have no idea why.

B000E5HETQ,0/0,5.0,"I saw some favorable reviews for the similar Diplomat box, but I wanted a secure latching feature (photo), so I got this one. It is nice looking with a nice finish. The finish looks very thick, almost decoupaged. From experience, I expect that thermal transients will eventully cause cracks in such a thick finish, but it will probably go for 10-15 years and look all right.Most buyers will want to use it as it is, but I wanted maximum storage in minimum volume. I was pleased to find that the divider boards are removable, not glued (photo). So the box can be used as an open jewelry box if desired.I have 18 watches stored in it without difficulty, using 0.012 vinyl envelopes from EverydayPlastics (photo). However, I should note that I have only one watch with an articulated metal bracelet.",watch

I have to admit though, after only two weeks of use, I am fairly disappointed. I replaced the strap almost immediately, which I found to be very stiff and uncomfortable. Also, the chronograph controls feel ""sticky"" and cheap. I can only describe the button feel as rough. Finally, my biggest problem with this watch is the face. After 2 weeks, there are scratches all over it. The crystal is unacceptable for a watch with a list price over $200.00.

The first one was lost the second was stored, improperly by me, with the glow light depressed which killed the battery.The low cost of this unit makes it not practical to change the battery. It is a bear to change and my watch did not work afterwards. - May not have been the watch's fault. The Glow light may have over heated the rest of the circuit.Only complaint: the Alarm is not loud enough or it is generated at too high of a frequency for me to hear.

For me however, it is important that a watch be lightweight and fit snugly, which it does, and i barely feel it. its not an attentiongrabber, but isnt tacky. i dont wear a watch everyday so wasnt looking for an investment, and this works out just fine for when I do feel like wearing one.",watch

You can definitely read it in dark conditions, but it's not overly bright to the point of being obnoxious. This was something that I considered above all else when purchasing and I'm not disappointed.In my particular case, I ordered this watch and ordered the leather wrist band as I'm not a fan of metal straps. Since the factory strap is being replaced with the Traser Leather one, I can not do a review on the strap.The red second hand does not function as the ""second hand"" in regular mode. This is handled by one of the other dials. If you're using it for a chronograph, then the second hand becomes active. I was a little disappointed by this, but it's nothing that would warrant sending it back to the seller over.This is my first Traser watch, but definitely won't be my last. I've already found another Traser which I'd like to own and plan to purchase within the next year.Is it worth $470? Yes, it is...

B0002291TW,2/2,3.0,"I like the idea of an analog and digital watch all in one nice set up. This watch provided that and more. And for the most part it was a pretty good dress watch that I used for my everyday watch. It was easy to look at when I needed the time or date and didn't look like a cheap watch and was made of pretty good quality metal all around.It has light up features that will let you see the read outs in the dark (For only 2 seconds which isn't very practical), has a sports watch timer which came in handy if you wanted to know how long you were doing something for or how long you had left on the parking meter and of course an alarm you can set to go off at a given time. It adjusted for day light savings and for the most part was a very nice watch which I enjoyed greatly.What I didn't like was that once the battery went on it, the watch was never the same again. It took about 4 or 5 years for the battery to die out on the watch so you get a good life span on it. But once said battery was changed I could never get the analog hands to work again no matter how many batteries were tried and even when I brought it to a store to fix they said it was no good. For some reason changing the battery for it just won't bring it back. The digital worked fine again so I managed as it was a nice watch that I had grown found of and honestly the digital part of it was more vital than the analog.Well 2 years later the battery stopped again and now the watch is no good. Locks up at 12:00 and can't change the settings on it. The watch had finally died and no way to revive it. Will I buy this watch again? No I won't. I can't accept an item that works well when it works but only works onces around and won't again like any other watch I have owned. And from reading the reviews I'm not the only one dealing with battery issues with the watch.It's a nice affordable and good quality watch, but once it dies you better be prepared to either deal with what you have working with it if anything or get a new watch all together. I am surprised that Timex would release such a faulty piece of equipment. It has a nice set up and great features but all they have to do is give it better battery life and not have it work improperly once the battery is replaced to at least give you a good long time of using the watch through a life time. As it is now the watch is worthless and I have to get another.I say give it a try if you want as it is a nice looking analog-digital watch. But I won't be buying it again due to not getting more life and usage out of it. Watches should last longer than 7 years. Sometimes I feel things are made not to last and this just came off as that due to the weird things that were happening after the battery died the first time around.But overall I would say try a different but similar brand watch that may give you better life than this one does. Such a shame too as I really did enjoy it when it worked right.",watch

B0006IHHMU,3/3,5.0,"I purchased my Black Monster 6 years ago. I had not worn a watch in a number of years, but I had always really liked watches, so I decided it was time for a new watch.Here is what I wanted. A watch that was completely stainless steel, did not need a battery, and could take a beating.Stainless steel because the oils in my skin will make short work of leather, rubber, and even some plastics.No battery because I don't want to change them.And could take a beating because I do repair work.like many others before me, I painstakingly plowed through reviews here on Amazon. I went to the watch forums and lurked and learned. I debated with myself over this and that, and in the end decided on the Black Monster.I've worn this watch almost every day since it came. I have worn it while I've pounded away with a hammer, while I've torn machinery to pieces, while I've crawled around on the floor in the dirt and grime.On a number of occasions, I've hammered on equipment while wearing this watch, so hard that I've had to take it off and stuff it in my pocket, because the weight of it thrashing around was starting to bruise my arm.This watch was been shown no mercy.So 6 years later how is it doing? It's doing fine.The case and bracelet have many small surface scratches that I'm sure could be polished out if I was inclined to do so, but it in no way has it started to look bad. If this watch had been shown love and care, instead of steady harsh abuse, I'm sure it would have no scratches at all.The crystal, as I look at it right now, has 3 scratches. One is more noticeable then the others, but you really have to be looking for scratches to see them.Make no mistake, this watch is as tough as nails.All the functions are in working order. The bezel I use to mark time almost every day. How long have I been at lunch, how long has dinner been in the oven.The bracelet locks and stays locked. -A funny side note. I was on a tour of the Neon Graveyard in Las Vegas last year and the guy giving the tour spotted my Black Monster and said that he was into watches and had never actually seen one before and asked if he could take a look at it. I said sure and handed it over. After looking closely at it he mentioned that it even had the ""wetsuit extension."" Now, I'd worn the watch so long and had never needed to use this feature, I'd completely forgotten that it was there!Time keeping. Since the very first, this watch has run a bit fast. After a month or so it will have gained about 5 minutes. I pull out the crown and set it back 5. This has not changed one bit since the day I got it. So it gains a little time, but it has been incredibly consistent.So would I recommend this watch? Yes I would.The reason I'm writing this review is because a few weeks ago I decided maybe I needed a new watch, a fancier one with a compass. I started the the process all over again. Looking at watches, making note of the features they had, reading tons of reviews. And don't get me wrong there are many fine time pieces out there. But I couldn't find one that I liked better then the one I already have. So I ordered a stand alone compass for $24 and was done with it. And have decided to stick with the Black Monster until one of us breaks.",watch

I've very glad I didn't because of the three watches my son received he likes this one the best.

B000IZC8FC,2/2,5.0,"I got this watch as a Christmas gift this year, and I have absolutely loved it from the start. Firstly, it is very light and durable. The titanium is much lighter and more comfortable than stainless steel, and the all metal construction ensures that the watch won't break or need pin replacement. The only fault with the watch, however, is that the titanium accumulates some minor and barely noticeable scratches more easily than a stainless one would, but none of them are major or glaring.Secondly, the ability to display 24-hr time, the day of the week and the date is a wonderful feature to have.The most important part of a watch though is the ability to keep time, and it has been a rock solid timekeeper since I first set it.On a purely aesthetic level, the watch is very nice looking and easily serves as both a dress and a casual watch. At night the dials are surprisingly bright and easy to read as well.All in all, there is nothing that I am able to complain about in this watch. I'm very pleased and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good looking and functional watch.",watch

The fact that this watch has the 'Accutron name' embossed instead of 'Bulova-Accutron' is the reason the jewelry store was selling this $895.00 watch for 40% off - thus being discontinued per the manager of the store.I ordered (2) from the Amazon website, opened them up and both are beautiful and look exactly as in the jewelry store.

B0009VC6U2,0/0,5.0,"This is an outstanding watch for outdoors and adventure type activities. The watch is large and weights a lot, and is very solid. The hand visibility is excellent and lume is pretty good. This is a quartz and not an automatic, but quartz can be better for some outdoors activities as it is more shock resistant and can take a beating. This one has a mineral glass rather than sapphire crystal, so it's more prone to scratches, but again - better for rough activities as sapphire can shatter from impact.Watch has a second time-zone function, so while not a true GMT, it does offer ability to monitor time in two time zones.Crown screws-in and the watch can serve you while swimming. It's not a true diver as the bezel can't be used to measure remaining time, but it's fine for swimming or casual non-timed diving.Bracelet is very substantial and has a great feel. The only thing people should be wary off is the milemarker trackwheel which can dig in to the skin if you have a smaller wrist.Great value for an excellent watch which is ready for swimming, hiking and other outdoors activities.",watch

When the stem is pulled all the way out to set the time the second hand stops (hack feature) On the 8926(c) the second hand does not stop when the stem is pulled out. The 9937 seem to be a little heavier then the 8926. I am very pleased with both watch's and will also look to add the 9094 to my collection in the future.

Not ! Once I got the back off I see the most complex battery clamp I had ever seen !I paid $5 for the battery, and then another $7 to take it to a watch repair place to have them do it right. Took the guy about 5 minutes to do it.The band still looks good. The first G shock I bought had to have the band changed once a year.And that watch lasted over 12 years before I had to replace it.Another thing I wasn't happy about is it's not made in Japan, but assembled in Thailand with Japanese parts...Over all, I'm happy with it.It's been a problem free watch.",watch

B0006IEX04,2/2,2.0,"Good functionality and visibility particularly with the night illumination, however the crystal is very easily scratched. It is domed up from the face of the watch so is quite exposed and seems to be made of a very soft material. The band looks a bit cheap too, but that's not a big deal. It's cheap enough I guess I'll just get another at some point, but I wish they made a similar watch but a bit more upmarket.Update:I like the watch mechanism and display fine, however I accidentally dragged it over a mattress and one of the plastic band anchors on the case broke off so it's impossible to put a band on it. How much could they possibly have saved on the cost by making the part the band attaches to out of cheap plastic rather than metal? The mind boggles.What Casio is thinking I have no idea, but bottom line is it's a pretty nice mechanism in a cereal box watch body. I recommend avoiding it because it's just too poorly made to be viable in normal use.",watch
B000E4ARNW,0/0,5.0,"This watch is the perfect marriage of ""classy"" and ""sporty"". I bought the metal bracelet version of this watch (WAF1110.BA0800) for work about a week before purchasing this one. I was so impressed by the quality and detail of the other watch that I knew I had to eventually buy the ""casual"" version. Thus, when price fell to below half price on Amazon.com, I quickly pulled the trigger again.The silver hour marks, including the ""12"" at the top, are raised on the dial and the hands are clean and elegant. The black dial is sleek and allows for easy reading of the time. I can't understand why anyone would want to try to read the time on a white or silver face with silver hands. I love the color Tag Heuer logo - something Tag should have kept on their new watches.Not only can you see the Tag quality, you can also feel it. The watch has some heft to it, which I was not used to at first. Now that I've gotten use to the weight, my older watches (both Swiss Army) feel kind of puny. The black rubber strap is soft and flexible and goes well with the black face. The watch is very comfortable to wear.The only minor negative attribute is that the second hand does not perfectly align with the hash marks all the way around the dial. It is aligned for about 30 seconds and then off by 10-25% for the other 30 seconds. However, from what I've read, this is typical for watches with quartz movement and not a big deal.Overall, I could not be happier with this purchase. I am very lucky to have to bought it at such a low price. This watch is worth every penny. If you can afford it, this beautiful timepiece which will undoubtedly last you decades and garner many compliments.",watch
B000E8CS5I,2/2,4.0,This watch is definitely more of a show piece then a standard watch. It appears crafted out of a single piece of aluminum which is cool. Gets some complements but also some stares (thinking what is that ugly duckling). It is definitely on the large size but isn't heavy due to being made out of aluminum. It is a basic analog watch and has no date feature. I have many watches but for some reason I wear this one quite a bit. My only concern is what happens with the band wears out because it appears fused to the watch. A bit pricy for a basic watch but I like the cool factor. It is tough but the case does get scratched easily.,watch

I was really impressed by the beauty of this watch as soon as I opened that big yellow show-box it rests in. The Dragon scales shimmered in the light, the nice large (but not overly so) size and ergonomic shape, the beautiful fit and finish, all popped out at me right away. Holding the Lupah and feeling it's smooth solidity was very reassuring and the whole experience shouted ""quality."" For less than $200 you get something which looks like it could cost many times that.I have some watches of pedigree which I spent big sums on. You all know what Swiss pieces can cost. Of course, I love them for what they are and I totally enjoy wearing them, looking at them, etc. Watch lovers know what I'm talking about in their own special way. But I have received complimentary comments from people on the Dragon and, in fact, my girlfriend asked me the other day if I would change from the Tag Heuer Chrono I had on to the Dragon because she just loved the way it looked on me.

The watch keeps excellent time and is beautifully finished. The machining is clean and crisp as you can expect from Japaneese products. I cannot find a single flaw on it. It is for sure orange (but that's what I ordered). The only problem I have is that it is not quite as large as I had hoped for. It is a big watch when compared to a wenger GST for example but not as big as an Invicta Grand Diver. It looks sporty as well as somewhat dressy. It would look more dressy if you got a black one but if you are wanting ""big"" better go with an Invicta Grand Diver (not the pro Diver which is smaller). But again, Seiko makes some mighty good stuff for the money and if you are wanting accurate timekeeping and good waterproffing I think this is a good choice.",watch

Another nice feature is the top circle window that displays the date or the current feature you are using. I have not tried diving with the watch so I can't say if it is truly waterproof or not.

B0007IR4U4,2/2,5.0,"I got this watch as a gift and love it. It's the watch I wanted and it really exceeded everything I wanted in terms of looks and function. It's beautiful, the band is just slightly different than all the rest and very distinctive. The face is black which I wanted, the roman numerals on the 12 and 6 look great. The month and date is big enough to see and located just where it should be. I like being able to see the time at night which is very easy with this watch. Never needing a battery is also a great feature. I feel for the price there is not a better watch out there! There are already a bunch of great reviews, but what I thought might help others is talking about the wrist band and how to take out links. I read a bunch of reviews prior to buying it and thought I'd have to take it to a jeweler for sure. They made it sound almost impossible, or that you would need to buy a special tool. Well, what I found was it was pretty simple. Not much instruction come with the watch, but you can print off some on the website at citizenwatch.com. What I did was get a little piece of wood and drilled a hole about 1/4 inch. The wood is only to support the watch so you can push the pin through and not scratch it. The hole needs to be lined up to let it pass through. The watch band has arrows that show the direction you have to push. I used a very small drill, 1/16, and a pair of Vise Grips, a small paper clip might also work, but you need a little force, so the Vise Grips work great. Each link has a pin and a small locking tube so work on a nice surface so you don't lose either. Putting the pin back in is easy too, just make sure you don't let the little locking tube slip out before you get the pin back in. I hope this helps, it's not rocket science, it's just pushing the pin in the right direction, then pushing it back in.",watch

You won't have to change the date manually on shorter months like you do with most analog watches.Of course this watch is solar too. The digital window has an indicator for H,M,S of how much battery life is left so you can be comfortable with knowing the battery is full.The watch also is made with G-Shock in mind.

It has great features like genuine Swiss ETA movement, sapphire crystal, and a trusted and well respected name brand.I did my homework before purchasing, and the only common negatives to this watch that I read were 1) ""the bracelet feels cheap"" and 2) ""it's too small"". To answer those, if you may have the same reservations - I think the bracelet feels decent. It's not heavy, but the watch is light so it fights the bracelet. I'm replacing it with a brown leather band, just because I was looking to buy a silver/white faced watch with a leather band originally (then bought this watch ha).The second point was that for a man this watch can be too small. Width is in the neighborhood of 36 mm (excluding crown), height is a little less than that. Most of my collection, save for a couple vintage Omegas, are 40+ mm. So in today's trend of bigger watches, this watch will look small compared to some other models. My wrist measure approximately 6.75"" and the watch fits me perfectly. Ultimately this is down to personal taste. But I have no reservations about putting this watch on in the morning!I've been very pleased with the accuracy.

Of course a parent should be sitting right there helping out!!! My son loves moving the mouse around because I taught him how to do it, not some software.

It's just like watching the TV - a parent (or other adult) needs to be sitting right there explaining stuff and interacting with him.

But saying it's bad because it forces a parent to spend time with the kid is not a good reason for a bad rating!",software

There is an upgrade for the software that takes away all the options for copying to your hard drive and decreases the chances of a good burn when doing a strait copy.

B00005APYU,0/0,1.0,"There are many different ideas on the best way for adults to learn a foreign language. Much depends on the student, their goals, and their self-discipline. Dealing with a tonal language, like Thai, or a language with a different type of script, also like Thai, the student need make some big decisions about how they want to learn, and how much.I learned Spanish as an adult. I am now fluent at a professional/business level.I learned to read Thai. I can write some, but my vocabulary is very small. 90% of my Thai came from taking private one-on-one classes while living in Thailand for 6 months.I studied some Tagalog, some Korean, and some Thai using Rosetta Stone.If you just want to learn some Thai to get around as a tourist, you probably want to use Romanized phonetics. Learning the script is not really worth your time. An immersion product, like Rosetta Stone, is probably not as useful because much of the vocabulary and context is not related to what you will want to know (do you really need to say the boy is under the soccer ball?).If you want to seriously learn the language to be able to carry on casual or business conversations, commit early and realize there is far more work.For me, I first needed to learn the alphabet. You CANNOT consistently pronounce Thai correctly using Romanized phonetics. T one rules are only consistent in Thai script. Among other challenges, the Romanization is wildly inconsistent. You learn it one way, and then another source using different phonetics mires you in confusion. The same is probably also true of Korean, as it is also a phonetic language. Learning Chinese will likely be different.Second, I realized for me, I need to take notes. As adults we want to take notes to help remember key points. If you take the notes in English, you are handicapping yourself. Learn the alphabet and take notes in Thai. Again, I think this is true for phonetic languages like Korean, or even Hirigana and Katakana for Japanese. I doubt this is viable for Chinese.Third, again for me, I knew learning translation would create a permanent handicap. Early on, translation is easier, later on translation must be unlearned as it stilts actual conversation and thinking. You just can't translate fast enough. Even now, being fluent in Spanish, translating gives me a headache and frustrates me. I either have a conversation in Spanish, thinking in Spanish, or I have a conversation in English thinking in English. If I know a word in one language and not the other, my whole train of thought is derailed. Avoiding learning translation is where Rosetta Stone shines.I like the idea of Rosetta Stone. If you are disciplined and do the lessons, you will expand your spoken vocabulary rapidly. You will remember what you learn. I doubt it will do much for reading and writing with non-Roman scripts. Like any learning tool, disciplined study will yield results.Rosetta Stone is very expensive. Competing products like L-Lingo or products using different methods like Pimsleur, TellMeMore.com, Assimil, or Fluenz (supposedly the best, but only in a few languages) are a fraction of the cost of Rosetta Stone. Many of the different methods will work better for some people than others. Assimil is translation based. Pimsleur is hard to describe, but has a very good fluency success rate (supposedly). Look up Fluenz also, as the method and reviews suggest it is very effective in the few languages they offer.Besides cost, what is the other drawback to Rosetta Stone?The drawbacks are legion.Version 2 is good. Version 2 is how Rosetta Stone grew into a powerhouse. Version 3 is a refinement of version 2 with improved continuity, a smoother interface, better quizzes, and the ability to get rid of the stupid ""must have CD with you at all times"" limitation.The real problem is Rosetta Stone dropped support for version 2. Even though they were selling version 2 from their own website in 2012, they dropped support. Mac users are especially impacted as Mac OSX Lion will no longer run PPC apps, and Rosetta Stone never ported the Version 2 application to Intel. So, if you bought version 2 in 2012 to use on a Mac, you were ripped off by Rosetta Stone. Join the crowd.Windows users should not be too smug about the situation, as the end of Version 2 support means your product will have all sorts of issues too, unless you downgrade to WinXP.Version 3 (never made for Thai) does run on current platforms, and is at least somewhat supported (to the extent Rosetta Stone supports any product). Given so many users prefer version 3 to version 4 though, don't be surprised if they pull a Microsoft and force you to their new product nobody wants.Total 4e (not an option for Thai), is a horrible retrograde of Rosetta Stone. The pinnacle is by far version 3. To be fair, if you are always connected -- literally 100% of the time -- and live your life via social media, Total 4e might be effective. Don't expect to use the highly touted iOS apps on your iPhone or iPad though unless you are connected either. The whole idea of quickly practicing while in line or waiting in an office...yeah, that doesn't conform to the Rosetta Stone licensing model.Speaking of which, Rosetta Stone now has two components and two licensing models. There is the online social media part, and the software application. The first is now on a subscription basis. You pay for every month you learn. You can still use the app on your computer, but you just paid a premium for online access you aren't using. Therein lies the reason so many people look at Total 4e and then try to find version 3 before supplies run out.How about another suggestion?Try L-Lingo. L-Lingo uses a substantially identical learning model as Rosetta Stone. The interface actually has more features than Rosetta Stone and you can customize the interface to use Roman phonetics or native script. They have a Thai program. They have iPad and iPhone/IPod Touch iOS apps which you can use on a plane or anywhere else, with or without Internet access. Best of all, all of their programs together (Win or Mac desktop, iPad, iPhone/iPod Touch) for Thai are less than half the cost of Rosetta Stone Level I Thai.L-Lingo specializes in Asian languages. They are probably a superior option to Rosetta Stone Total 4e for most users. L-Lingo offers a free trial for their desktop application, and also for their iOS applicastions for some languages.There are other good options listed above, particularly Fluenz and Pimsleur. Be sure to check them out before buying anything made by Rosetta Stone.",software

B0000CFYN5,46/47,4.0,"You might be asking yourself, should I get the City Select Europe or the City Navigator Europe for about twice the price? I can't answer the question for you but I can say that I just returned from a 3 week trip where we drove all over Switzerland and France (including Paris) using City Select Europe and I'm glad I made the purchase.I loaded my 2610 (North America basemap) with a good portion of eastern Europe before I departed. Once there, I was surprised how quickly the GPS acquired satelites and provided position and directional information. The GPS did a fine job of directing us from the airport to our hotel, from the hotel to sights in the area, to our hotel in Paris, to side trips to Dijon and Basil, etc. Worked equally well in cities and between cities.The only problems I found, and these are not major ones IMHO, are:* Once the GPS told us to take exit 46. But the exits have no numbers!* Several times the GPS told us to take an exit using a description that was not on the exit.In both cases, the audible directions (&quot;in 2 kilometers exit right&quot;) and maps (showing the turn) were correct.So what's the difference between City Select and City Navigator for Europe other than the price? I contacted Garmin, they say that &quot;City Navigator handles rotaries (roundabouts) better&quot;. I did not see any problems with roundabouts during my trip.I suspect that the City Navigator has more points of interest loaded, but I don't know this for a fact. Bottom line, I would recommend City Select Europe to anyone with a 2610 needing to travel in and around the countries it covers.",software

B00002SFM4,3/4,3.0,"I have designed many websites over the past years with FrontPage 98/2000. The program is easy to use and fairly intuitive. Unfortunately, it has some MAJOR drawbacks: 1) FP2000 isn't Netscape compatible. What works beautifully in Explorer has the potential to look like a mess in Netscape. I don't know if that's Microsoft's way of snubbing Netscape...but it's a hassle. 2) The layout tables are 'stiff'. In a webpage you use tables to keep your content in place, and while FP has an easy to use table tool, it's very clunky. You can't place certain images in seperate cells because they 'offset' each other. Additionally, it is nearly impossable to customize a table to fit your text correctly...making the formatting of text a pain in the neck. 3) FP extensions are easily corrupted. For some reason the FrontPage extensions at my ISPs servers corrupt often, therefore I have to call them and get them reinstalled.Other than those concerns FP is a wonderfully easy to use program. If you want a simple yet professional quickie website, this is the program to buy. Eventually you will want stronger tools and a more intuitive interface...When that day comes, just buy Macromedia Dreamweaver.",software

JumpStart Advanced 1st Grade was among the first JumpStart games I've owned; only JumpStart Kindergarten (Deluxe, not Advanced, version) predates it. I think I (or someone else) got it for Christmas a LONG time ago. Since this particular version of JumpStart Advanced 1st Grade comes with 3 CD-ROMs, I will review each individually. (There is also a 4-CD-ROM version, BTW.) My review will be pretty long, 'cause it's really more like 3 reviews stuck together with little extra bits at the start & end. If you don't want to read all 3 parts, just read the first ""Fundamentals"" part and the bit at the bottom. Here we go!#1: FUNDAMENTALSThis is, by far, the BEST CD-ROM in the set. It was originally sold individually as the original JumpStart Advanced 1st Grade. In this game, a little dog named Squirt is just riding his scooter peacefully when Jimmy Bumbles, a weasel & school bully, knocks him off and breaks his scooter. Luckily, Squirt's OK, but no longer has a scooter. However, the prize for winning the JumpStart Scooter Tournament (which is coming up) is a new Super Scooter! Unfortunately, Squirt can't really win it, because...uh, he has no scooter. More familiar JumpStart friends such as Frankie the dog and Hopsalot the rabbit are determined to win it for him. However, Jimmy has supreme scooter skills, and the only way the JumpStart pals can stand a chance against him is to add gadgets to their scooters. All of your JumpStart friends will be happy to give you gadgets to add, but they need some favors to be done. Also, some of the gadgets need to be obtained in special ways. Kids complete these tasks in the form of games to earn scooter power-ups.This CD-ROM is very good. Not only are the games VERY fun, but they teach a wide variety of 1st Grade subjects - everything from math to early zoology. I think this is where I learned adding double-digit numbers, alphabetizing, and ordinals. My younger sister, Chocolate Dog, also benefited from it.This game, like other JumpStart Advanced ""Fundamentals"" CD-ROMs, has a feature called the ""All Star"". At the start of the game, kids are instructed to ""take a quiz & find out their learning style"". As a young child, I found this confusing, and I think I ended up just clicking on my favorite character. That's the bad part. The good part: In the corner of the screen of the main game, there is a star. When clicked, a phone pops up. You can call up your JumpStart pals for info on all the subjects taught in the game. Each character gives different kinds of information. I usually find Hopsalot's straightforward answers to be most helpful. Sometimes, the scientific nature-loving CJ Frog is a help. It really depends, and I don't think kids just have a single learning style.I think that JumpStart Advanced 1st Grade Fundamentals is quite good. There are a few things that bug me, though. For one thing, some games, such as Casey Cat's Phonics Soccer & CJ Frog's Spelling/Math Swamp Game, must be played over and over and over and OVER again to earn a single power-up. Because of this, we avoided them. Also, since many of the games are arcade-styled, you can sometimes get an incorrect answer simply due to obstacles, bad aim, etc. In additon, you can trade power-ups, which I think is good, but I had to go to the online user manual to find out how - it wasn't clear at all. However, this CD-ROM is overall the best one in the JumpStart Advanced 1st Grade 3-pack, hands down.#2: MUSICThough Fundamentals is very high quality, this CD-ROM, ""Music"", takes a deep dive downward when it comes to quality. In this game, Hopsalot the rabbit gets sucked up into an heirloom gramophone. Totally bogus, huh? He is whisked away to the weird & wacky world of ""The Land of Music"". A big weirdo guy named Sir Sournote is causing trouble and making all the music sour. So duh, Hopsalot has to stop him.Not only are the activities & games on this CD-ROM very BORING, but they are also very difficult. OK, so there's this game (actually, a lot of games) where you must repeat a beat. IT'S SERIOUSLY HARD. This game is for ages 5-8 and, even if you're way over the top of the age range, it is still difficult to get the beats right. And if you don't get the beats right, then the characters might insult you: ""THAT'S BAAAAAAAAAAAD!""This CD-ROM frustrates and annoys MUCH more than it teaches. Please DO NOT buy the individually sold version of JumpStart Music! You might find that your money is wasted! We have not played this LAME GAME in YEARS. If you seriously want to get it, PLEASE get it in with JumpStart Advanced 1st Grade ~OR~ get one of the 4 different JumpStart Fun Packs: Preschool, Kindergarten, 1st Grade and/or 2nd Grade. I've never played any JumpStart Fun Pack, but all of them but Preschool come with JumpStart Music. Not that anybody would actually want JumpStart Music...#3: ART CLUBJumpStart Art Club is the only disc that comes with JumpStart Advanced 1st Grade that was never sold individually. Indeed, it comes only with this pack (and the 4-CD-ROM version). It is sorta in-between Fundamentals & Music: not super good, not super bad, just in-between. In this CD-ROM, you make storybooks, crafts, banners & greeting cards starring your favorite JumpStart friends. It is pretty fun to make the crafts & entertaining to make all sorts of stories for the storybooks, but it is a very simple CD-ROM. There really isn't any animation in it, and all of the projects are simplified (the storybooks can only have up to 6 pages, you only design the front of the greeting cards, etc.). You never really ""draw"" in any of the projects - you mostly just use stickers. Coloring in spaces is the closest you ever get. Also, it really doesn't have educational value. It *sorta* teaches *a little bit of* creativity, but other than that, zero-zilch-nada. Overall, it's OK, MUCH better than Music, but definitely worse than Fundamentals.Overall, JumpStart Advanced 1st Grade 3-CD-ROM set is pretty darn good. The Music & Art Club CD-ROMs aren't so great, though, so you might consider getting the original JumpStart Advanced 1st Grade with only the one Fundamentals CD-ROM. You might consider the 4-CD-ROM version, though I've never played it. Check out some of the other great JumpStart games & workbooks! Signed, StoryMaker. ""Gotta trust the kid's review!""",software

B000HCTYTE,34/82,2.0,"For some time now Windows has been nagging customers about their new software. Well, not nagging, but over-advertising, should I say. I currently have XP. I will keep buying Windows's operating systems for the simple fact that not only are their OS's are cheaper, but are much, how to I put this, more intruitive to the internet world. I might as well be the very first person to ""see"" and play around with the Vista so far (just through reading reviews). Microsfot promises a much more stable and secure computer, two factors Mac has ALWAYS and probably will forever have above them. The question is, what really are they doing back there in Microsoft land? No offense to all the hype of the OS, I'm sure I will want to upgrade within the next two years but I must ask, how on earth is this consdiered better than XP?Now there are many factotrs to an OS, this one not so complicated. Really the most unimpresive thing was that it was already made. And chances are, you own it. There's not much of a difference between XP and Vista other than some new features that may spike an impulse buy. But please BEFORE you do that, know what you are buying into. There are really only a few reasons to upgrade from XP to Vista.1. You want to network with Windows. XP doesn't really have such a great networking stradegy, if it really is one to begin with. It is a way better OS than XP as far as linking computers together. This also makes it much easier to share a DSL internet connection, but even then XP has this feature, and its not that hard. Wireless networking also comes in, thanks to ethernet, Bluetooth, and other collabrations.2. The way you open windows. And even then, is that really a reason to upgrade your version of Windows. Anyhow, it comes with a slick black/chrome scheme. Opening and minimizing Windows becomes more like a Mac. You can view your Windows like a flow or in 3D.Otherwise, most of Vista is a true dissappoint.Security is a big issue with Windows computers and you should always have Norton, McAfee, AVG, or some sort of third party anti-virus vendor. And in Vista, you still do, because much like its big brother XP, it is full of security holes. The firewall is really nothing more than the one you have with XP. It asks you when certain files try to download onto your computer, but that's about it. It doesn't really try to stop viruses or adware, something a Mac is virtually prone to. Otherwise, same old, same old. Firewall, and that's about it as far as what Windows offers for security. They also have their Spyware detector, but Ad-Aware is not only cleaner and more efficent but has a longer list of definitions. Lame. And the look, nothing more than having your Windows XP taskbar, menus, and start button black. Nothing at all has yet to be added on to it. No dock, no easy search, no nothing. Just your same old XP look, only black and chrome. Yawn. (Besides, can't you get those for free online?) The so called ""Aero"" graphics window frames are nothing special. The only interesting feature is that you can mouse over the items you have open. Lame. Also, no multimedia enhancements. Same Windows Media Player and same DVD maker. Lame. The so called backup program is awful. You have to back up a whole thing of files, like ""My Computer"" or ""Documents"". Lame. Also know if you are planning on upgrading Vista you must have a pretty good computer or your sstem will just keep on crashing. Of course XP does that enough. Not very comforting to know Vista does that more than XP. Lame.Oveall, not a needed upgrade for your Windows XP system. Some networking features are nice, and the look is slightly appealing, but otherwise it's Windows XP packaged into a different box. The enw security features aren't really anything, nothing new with multimedia, and the new backup program is a complete dud. Keep your XP system, this isn't worth the extra hundred dollars. 2 stars.",software

B0000CAVS8,5/5,5.0,"DREAMWEAVER MX 2004...Dreamweaver is a seriously big application with advanced development tools for Web site design and maintenance. It lets designers swiftly create layouts, and developers incorporate the latest in data-driven applications. Sporting a reasonably uncluttered but intricate interface, Dreamweaver MX 2004 offers quite a bit of handholding in the form of automatic code generation and provides an excellent interface for directly accessing HTML code. This version adds features for the newest Active Server components and more powerful Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) support. Dreamweaver isn't for everyone, though. Adobe users will be more comfortable with GoLive, while non-professional site designers should consider the less formidable (and less powerful) Microsoft offering: FrontPage.Pros: Extremely powerful Web development application; new support for CSS; start-up page simplifies options; verifies code for multiple browsers.Cons: Steep learning curve; expensive technical support options after the 90-day free period.FLASH MX 2004...Macromedia's new Flash MX 2004 Flash animation designer requires less programming, boasts a much improved help system and offers new usability features such as an improved video-import wizard with editing capabilities, a spelling checker and a find-and-replace function. Although beginners might not find it as easy to use as Adobe's cheaper LiveMotion, MX 2004 is a uniquely powerful program. It's a must-have upgrade for current users, thanks to its new support for Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), an improved (and ECMAScript 3.0-compatible) ActionScript 2 programming language, and a new API that allows third-party plug-ins. A professional version that offers more data-handling features and components is also available -- albeit for twice the price.Pros: Powerful scripting language; FX and interactive objects now require less programming; new API for plug-ins; new usability features.Cons: Programming expertise required for complex projects; you must activate the product via the Internet or phone.FIREWORKS MX 2004...Adobe tries hard with ImageReady, but when it comes to Web graphics creation, Macromedia's Fireworks is still the undisputed king. It sports a comprehensive set of graphics tools; a sleek, efficient interface; and tight integration with other members of Macromedia's MX family (Dreamweaver, Flash, FreeHand). The program is simple to master, too. Although it's a little light in the bitmap-editing department, Fireworks more than compensates with super-slick special effects and effortless exporting to all popular Web graphics formats. We recommend this program for both amateurs and professionals who need any type of Web graphics and want the best application money can buy.Pros: Sleek, efficient interface; tight integration with other Macromedia Web products; easily applied special effects and creation of complex objects.Cons: Image-editing tools a little weak; no curved animation paths.",software

B000AOGDM0,18/19,2.0,"Microsoft Streets and Trips 2006 with GPS Locator is a great program for accessing maps all around the United States. The GPS works well and is never too far away from your target when it is given full view of the sky. But, if you are are buying this product for verbal directions, DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!!! It gives you very little verbal directions and if you go off route, it says ONLY the following: ""off route"" What help is this? Where do you go? You tell me! I would, totally, buy DeLorme with the GPS locator before buying this one. DeLorme tells you (verbally) every turn in good detail and tells you how to get back on the right road if you stray off route. An example of what it says when you are off route is: ""off route. Recalculating route. Turn left on Baltic Avenue, approaching in 4.3 miles, 5 minutes away."" This is much better then what this program will tell you: ""Off route"". This program is better then DeLorme as far as the maps are concerned but DeLorme is better as the GPS is concerned. This product has really dissapointed me, because I thought Microsoft would work very hard to compete with DeLorme, but they did not try very hard and the verbal directions turned out to be very, very poor.

B000AP2X0U,21/22,5.0,"At work, I edit commercial DV video using Final Cut Pro 5 and do effects in Apple Motion on a powerful MAC workstation. I'm also learning After Effects 6.5 Pro & 7 Pro. I needed something cheap to do small home projects. I also needed something for creating DVD's.I did a lot of research on the best Windows based DV NLE (digital video non-linear editor) in the $50 - $150 price range and Sony Vegas Movie Studio came out on top in every category especially with end user satisfaction and stability. I looked at: Adobe Premiere Elements, AVE Visual Editor, Avid Free DV, Cyberlink PowerDirector, EditStudio, Jashaka, MainActor, Magix Movie Edit Pro, Pinnacle Studio, Roxio VideoWave, Ulead Videostudio, Vegas Movie Studio, Video Edit Magic and Windows Movie Maker. Again, Sony Vegas Movie Studio came out on top in every category especially with end user satisfaction and stability. Many of the other top programs received so many complaints of instability, software crashes and OS system file corruption that I was surprised and disappointed. So I knew Vegas Movie Studio was the only real choice. With the trial version, I was able to do some nice editing and was sold on it immediately! Why?Sony Vegas Movie Studio really surprised me to be so power packed with features I would have only expected in a professional editor such as ripple, 4 tracks of video and 4 tracks of audio; the ability to reorder tracks by stretching them above or below other tracks; the ability to layer video/audio and do simple compositing; the ability to repeat content on a track by dragging it on along the timeline ... a feature even Apple Motion can't do without having to create new layers. Although some of the features are a bit childish the way they are displayed such as Video FX samples and text editing being somewhat limited, I still remind myself that this is a $100 consumer level product. Then there are keyframes for precise timing control!!! Man!! Keyframe editing in a $100 program! This is the bomb!! Oh yeah, 3-Wheel primary color correction like in Final Cut!! It can output in Quicktime .mov format too!! It can display output on an external monitor. It can adjust the speed and even reverse video in a very intuitive way! It can be extended with plug-ins. This is almost crazy! ... for $100!! No way! If you dig deep, tweak some of the settings and utilize the keyframes, you can get some unexpected multi-layered video effects that take PIP (picture-in-picture) to a whole new level! ... far beyond what I found in the manual or the company advertises can be done.Of course, it's not perfect. The DVD Architect Studio is a joke; especially compared to iDVD on a Mac. There's absolutely no imagination on the part of the theme designers whatsoever and the software's ability to design cool motion based menus, if possible, is lame at best! I haven't tried ACID XMC yet. Nor have I checked out the bundled sound effects yet. I just wish the video editor had better support for compositing. I'd love to be able to incorporate Digital Juice wipes, overlays and alpha channel stills. I guess I'm just spoiled by the pro apps. No video scopes either but this IS consumer level software.Nevertheless, the NLE video editor alone at the low price I paid is well worth giving the software 5 stars! Kudos to Sony!",software

My problem is I need tools such as a workhorse spreadsheet program, a powerful word processor, a flexible database, and stunning presentation program to successfully complete my job. Upon purchasing Office 2007, I was expecting expanded features and functions to assist me in doing so, just like every update had previously provided me. Instead I found myself with a redesigned interface (which takes time to learn) and an actual reduction of features from Office 2003 (which Microsoft freely admits occurred, because they couldn't fit a few of the features into the new interface). So what you are in fact spending your hard earned money on is a group of programs designed to look really good (with neato 3D graphics, wow!), but at the expense of taking away your tools rather than expanding them.Waste of money?

B00081PRD6,39/40,1.0,"I used to enjoy Autocad LT so much more than the full version of Autocad. For someone like me who does production drawings, LT was a great thing. It simplified and sped up the process. When I recently purchased the upgrade from Autocad LT 2004 to LT 2006, all of this changed. I felt like I was back in the day, trying to install Autocad Release 8.It took more than a few tries to install the upgrade to Autocad LT 2006. Once I did install it, I needed to uninstall it, since it was lethargic and crashed the computer.Here are some of the major issues I had:1. LT installs usually go smoothly. This install was as frustrating as they come. But not just because of the usual bugs. There were too many choices required and none of these choices was clearly explained.(A muddy explanation is hidden in the documentation)This leads to a fork in the install:2. ""Stand-Alone"" or ""Multi-Seat"" install. I purchased a single license. Why is the ""Multi-Seat"" option even offered during this installation? I asked someone at Autodesk what would have happened if I had done the ""Multi-Seat"" install. I would have to pay to get the activation codes.3. The activation codes are now 32 characters long and are only good for one use. If you need to re-install Autocad LT 2006 on a new computer or on the supposed second ""allowed"" computer with a ""stand-alone"" license, you must call and go through the same drill again. The on-line activation process didn't work. I talked to friends who said it didn't work for them, either. This process was very frustrating. If you want to avoid this for your second computer, you may use the ""portable license"" feature. This allows you to transfer Autocad LT from one computer to another, but then disables Autocad LT on the first computer after 24 hours.The first installation went very poorly. There was some promise with the settings migration. This feature was nice and it worked. This was about the only thing that worked on the first installation. After the migration and the activation, the computer froze. After re-booting, I tried again. Autocad LT 2006 was extremely sluggish. No other programs could run at the same time. I uninstalled 2 programs, to no avail. It took 4 minutes to install a 1 megabyte drawing. I uninstalled LT 2006.The next day, I tried again. It went a little better this time. The install was smoother. This time, LT ran more smoothly. When I got into the heart of the changes, I was very disappointed. All of that money for renamed old commands. An added calculator? I have a calculator, thank you, and it cost me a lot less than this upgrade. The previews from Autodesk lead one to believe there are truly good things about this version of Autocad LT. There aren't. I never had problems plotting prior to this. Now I do!It seems the primary goal of these upgrades is not a better product for the consumer, but added security measures for Autodesk. The result is incredible frustration for the consumer.",software

B00004U5R1,6/8,3.0,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 5-year old who had tried out a few scenes at Disneyland's Innoventions exhibit. Overall, she enjoyed the game and made her way through the scenes with just a little help. The programmers could have made the interface a bit better, though. The &quot;hot zones&quot; (where the pointer changes to allow for an action) are a bit small for some items so it gets difficult to position the mouse over an object to pick it up. Sometimes the pointer doesn't change at all. The system requirements are a bit high and we got just a &quot;good&quot; performance on my child's 300Mhz PII with a 32x SCSI CD-ROM. There are a number of bugs that we found as well. Mickey starts slanting at a 45-degree angle at the pond if you have him repeat a few actions. Music cuts out intermittently at a few scenes. There's also a problem with some earlier revisions of this game and it won't load if your system date goes past 12/31/2000 (a fix was posted to the www.disneyinteractive.com website recently). Overall, this was a decent try but I'd hope that Disney Interactive does a better job next time. I saw the earlier reviews and they seemed split 50-50 between &quot;fantastico&quot; and &quot;thppth&quot;. If you think you're PC-savvy enough to deal with these bugs and if your system has the horsepower, this program won't be excessively problematic.",software

Even though I owned the latest version of Virus Scan and FireWall - I thought best to buy McAfee's Internet Security Suite.What a mistake.It seems that there is a critical bug in SpamKiller. SpamKiller captures legitimate emails and does not pass them to Outlook.This is a very tricky bug because it does not block 100% of the emails - so a user will not immediately realize that there is a problem.I estimate about 30% of all emails sent to me never made it to outlook.For me this problem went on for a couple of weeks - I initially attributed it to a new email address.However, after checking with my DSL provider, I went to McAfee's website.Buried deep inside the bowels of the website in the SpamKiller forum, I discovered that this is a known bug and that it has been a problem for at least 4 months.Fortunately, the dropped emails are visible in SpamKiller - you cannot print them - you cannot mot move them - they are difficult to copy and save - but you can read them.You can only imagine how horrified I was to discover several critical business emails that I had not received.This is a terribly disappointing experience.To resolve the problem - I removed SpamKillerA software bug this critical requires immediate resolution by McAfee - whatever their reason - they have not fixed it.Worse, they have done nothing to warn users.",software

If you want to learn the rules and mechanisms required to combine words and form sentences in Spanish, you will have to buy a good Spanish grammar book.

B000077DCZ,25/26,4.0,"Before I review the excellent Rosetta Stone software, I should make a general disclaimer about the Chinese Language: it is not a language you should try to learn independent from a class. The pronunciation and writing system are such that you are likely to fossilize a lot of errors at the very beginning if you do not have real instruction to help you along. Furthermore, the writing system is best learned in a class. So, this program is best used in conjunction with a class or after already having taken some. Otherwise you are likely to be quickly overloaded & lost by this program.Languages are divided into four skills, as is the Rosetta Stone, which I'll treat individually:Listening- ExcellentOne of the real strengths of the Rosetta Stone program is that it relies on using a combination of pictures and contexts in order to lead the student to guess the meaning of the words being presented. Students who go along with this will find that they learn words much more effectively, because the process by which the word was figured out is remembered along with its meaning. This methodology is the best available; when I was at the Middlebury Chinese Language School, many teachers there tried to use this method on much vaguer clues than Rosetta, often with ridiculous hand gestures. Sometimes it didn't work, and they'd give the English meaning afterwards. But I remember the process by which we were taught the words, which reinforced the meanings such that I never had to actually study them.If, during the initial listening comprehension sections you don't know the meaning of the word, then you should look it up. I generally make an educated guess about what's going on, then look it up to be certain. But the problem solving method is superior and is really rather unique to Rosetta Stone.Speaking- ExcellentThe speaking section of this program is important because, in Mandarin, pronunciation is extremely hard. The Rosetta Stone measures your voice and compares your pronunciation to a native speaker, and checks to see how accurate you are. This is the only way I have found to reliably practice sentence-level intonation of Mandarin at the beginning levels. A student who uses this program and tests their speaking as ""good"" will not only memorize the words and expressions being used, but come out with great pronunciation.Reading- SatisfactoryAll of the reading material in the Rosetta Stone is the same as the listening and speaking sections, which makes it rather useless because your mind can become accustomed to 'filling in the blanks' with the characters you don't know. It does have marginal use, though, but the program's saving grace is its ability to switch between traditional and simplified characters, allowing you to get exposure to both.Writing - Useless and BrokenThis is the great failing point of the program. There is absolutely no way to input a Chinese Character into this program, at such insane levels that it appears that the programmers intentionally blocked characters from the writing section. You cannot copy and paste, use handwriting recognition, or use a pinyin input system such as NJStar Communicator to put characters into this program. All of my attempts have either resulted in inputting ""/"" or ""v"" instead of a real character, despire that any other programs will accept it. All you can input is pinyin, which is NOT chinese writing. It is the phonetic system.If the Rosetta Stone software were to truly build writing skills, it would be compatible with handwriting recognition software, or at least pinyin input. Since it's not, the program is worthless for writing. The program does have a 'tile matching' program which actually builds reading comprehension and grammar instead.-----Bottom Line:The Rosetta Stone software is excellent and a worthwhile buy, though in its current state can only stand as a supplement to a real Chinese class.",software

However, it is a version 1.0 and it needs some growing up to do.You can't export to HTML but you can export to Quicktime, PDF, and Powerpoint. When you do export to Powerpoint you can not have all the bells and whistles that you may have loaded your presentation with. Keynote has different transitions and fonts than Powerpoint so those get lost when you export. My first trial presentation I loaded it with all the effects possible (transitions, shadows, animations, etc.) and exported to all the possible formats. It was very easy to do but none of the other formats looked as good as the original Keynote presentation. The Powerpoint presentation did come close but the graphics compared to Keynote just did not stand up. I did have to make some adjustments in Keynote to make the Powerpoint version better (took out the shadows). When you make a movie you decide just how big you want it to be for the purpose of sending it via e-mail or posting it on the Internet. It was also incredibly easy making a PDF file.Where it does come strong is in graphics. The slides look beautiful and so does the text and the pie charts and graphs.

Annoying.* Fire roads in state parks (Big Basin Redwoods for me) show up BARELY, but are not named. Park trails do not show up.* A lot of window boxes are &quot;modal&quot;.. meaning you can't leave the window open while viewing another window. This means that you can't compare legs of routes side-by-side. You can't compare route profiles. These are unnecessary (AFAIK) limitations in the software and should be considered bugs.* As you might expect, there are occasional inaccuracies in the map, specifically in the urban areas. The maps tend to be older sometimes, which I guess can cause these problems. Don't buy this as a reliable road map.* The CA set consists of like 12 cds. You have to insert like 5 of them and go through InstallShield for each one so that TNav knows you have the region (and haven't pirated it). You still have to insert each of the 12 cds whenever you want to view a different region. I haven't seen an option to cache the map data on hard drive instead of inserting the cds.On the positive side, this program does have really need route/waypoint features.

This product does offer the complete Bible in audio, and it is convenient to listen to in the car or at other times. I use it at times in connection with actual reading so I am both hearing and seeing the words (it helps it sink in more). The production quality is good, clear, and well formatted.The problem I have with this product is Max McLean's voice and vocal style. It seems exaggerated, overly dramatic, forced, and unnatural. While this is a recording of the NIV, at times is makes me think of the King James Version simply because of his delivery. His pronunciation often annoys me. This, of course, is a personal preference, and according to other reviews, many people love his performance. My advice is to find a way to listen to part of this recording before purchasing it (there are places online where you can do this). You might side with the majority of the reviews and love it, but you might also feel as I do and choose a different reader.

B0002UDM2Q,56/63,2.0,"What a sad disappointment! Was looking forward to 16-bit tools and menu commands to follow through with the (truly splendid) Camera RAW converter. And yes, although that plug-in literally provides 16-bit SUPPORT, that's only a half-truth (pun), in that the 16-bit converted file works with neither layers nor tools. Other than for cropping or resizing you'll have to downsize first to 8-bit/channel images for the image editing tools to function - in other words, no advantage over PSE2. The User Manual, so informative in PSE2, now is a glossy blurb bragging about what the program can do (and omitting the 16-bit deceipt), but not a word on how-to-do-it. The 'Program Help', likewise, proves of limited help, and even those clever how-to recipes have been cut back since the PSE2 version. The neat new interface, conversely, is a substantial improvement over PSE2. Support? Go to an online 'User Forum' where kind users might offer advice, else pay for telephone support (?offshore?).Folding the massive Photo Album ""Organizer"" program into the image processing ""Editor"" has mushroomed the code from a lean and mean 92MB to a pudgy 220MB sloth. Even on my 2.8GHz Pentium with 1 GB RAM, two hard drives and a fast NVidea graphics card, merely enlarging a window - or just watching the screen saver - is tediously slow, and jarringly jerky. This would have been a happier marriage had Adobe offered a choice of whether or not to install Photo Browser, and save some 100 MB of deadweight overhead, since there are worthwhile enhancements on the image processing side such as the RAW Converter (ACR) plugin, and the neat Healing Brush. The ""new"" PSE release reminds me of Microsoft folding its browser into the Windows operating system; it's bloated, clumsy, slow, and adds yet another layer of commands. All told, PSE3 is just PSE2 in fancy drag on wobbly high heels.The unintuitive ""Organizer"" is a beast of a resource-hog that heaps on loads of cutesy bells & whistles, but adds little of substance. If the guide-book cottage industry is any indication, PSE3 tips and hints differ but little from those in PSE2 versions; most of the new material addresses the Photo Organizer and its bag of tricks. Tip: create a shortcut to just the ""Editor"", and use the latter's File Browser to import images, altogether bypassing the 'Organizer'.As you will note from the mixed reviews, two distinct user groups emerge: Those mainly seeking to organize their sprawling photo collection, printing postcards, and creating slideshows - perhaps with a ""Quick Fix"" tweak here and there - are quite pleased. Those who use Elements as a ""poor man's PhotoShop"" for advanced digital image editing, conversely, are decidedly unhappy with the bulked-up code overhead that slows operations down to a crawl, yet fails to deliver on the 16-bit processing claim.POSTSCRIPT: I took advantage of Adobe's promotion to upgrade, at an attractive price, to Photoshop CS - praise be. Then, in attempting to UNinstall PSE3, I ran into yet another nasty problem when the routine failed to recognize a critical file on the CD [""not valid""] although it was clearly present and (being write-protected on the installation CD) uncorrupted. Had to spend hours with an uninstall utility to remove the software, the numerous tentacles into the registry, and deal with the difficult issue whether a shared file could be deleted safely. All I can say is: hold off purchase till the next version.",software

I tried many, many configurations and settings to no avail; access to frequently visited websites with security even minimally active was often a no go. Disable the security and bam, I am right in. I tried symantic's online support but could not find information even closely related to this issue, only option is pay for support which cost more then the product.I now have the product set to perform only virus protection and ad blocking on my system and the same plus filtering on my children's systems. These features are most useful and seem to cause the least amount of aggrevation. I have installed a hardware firewall now so the security features are moot at this point.

B0002MPYIY,13/14,4.0,"I bought PC Relocator Ultra Control because it's what they use at my local CompUSA. I'm certainly no tech-head, but PC Relocator Ultra Control worked pretty much fine for me, with the caveat that I needed to use some intuition to solve some glitches. Let me share some of the details of my experience, which hopefully will help you if you come across the same problems; or you can just scroll down to my bottom line.When you first run PC Relocator Ultra Control, it asks if you want to let it automatically close all running programs and processes. Each of my computers crashed when I said yes. I think it closes some necessary system processes that should not be closed. So the next time I simply said no and I experienced no problems. Make sure you manually close as much as you can (right click on the icons on the lower right hand corner of your desktop taskbar and select close or exit).Do make sure you follow the directions for your screensaver and power settings and to scan and prepare your hard drives before relocation. In fact, IT CAN NEVER HURT TO READ THOROUGHLY ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS, both in the box and the user manual document included in the installed program, and to watch all the short tutorial videos.I had a problem similar to another reviewer's when migrating from a PC running Windows 98SE to a PC running XP. PC Relocator warned me that my user names were not the same. I don't use any password settings to sign in to my computer, so I have no custom user names. PC Relocator informed me that my 98SE default user was ""Unknown User"" and my XP user was named ""Owner."" All I did was log out of ""Unknown User"" on my 98SE PC and log in as ""Owner."" I just typed ""Owner"" on the log in screen and didn't need to do anything special to create the user.I used STANDARD selectivity, not automatic or expert. I can't speak to the ease of use of the latter two, but standard worked fine for me. It was extremely easy to scroll through the list of files and programs and select what I wanted to migrate. PC Relocator had almost no problems migrating the programs that it rated as ""high"" and ""medium"" probability of success. Naturally, there are always going to be some things it can't migrate.The transfer was very fast with the enclosed USB 2.0 cable. About 1.2GB migrated in about 45 minutes. There were some minor glitches, including having to reinstall one of my critical programs for which I still had the installation disk (that's my biggest piece of advice...ALWAYS KEEP YOUR INSTALLATION DISKS where you'll be able to find them later!). I also had to uninstall some older or trial versions of my programs on my new PC before the relocation or else PC Relocator wouldn't migrate them.THE BOTTOM LINE: A GREAT VALUE FOR THE MONEY COMPARED WITH USING A PROFESSIONAL, WORTH THE EXTRA COST COMPARED WITH COMPETING PRODUCTS. BUT IF YOU KNOW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT COMPUTER SOFTWARE AND AREN'T A FAIRLY INTUITIVE TINKER, SPEND YOUR TIME AND MONEY HAVING A PROFESSIONAL DO YOUR RELOCATION.",software

The OS launches in a reasonable amount of time and performance I observed is at the level of a Pentium 2 (maybe a 3). Sound card performance is slightly choppy as well. Granted I've not thoroughly tested it out yet and perhaps some tuning will improve performance. Perhaps this product may be an acquired taste. I would suggest this product does have usefulness -- for cross platform testing and for apps that are not too resource intensive.

We described the problem to Executive Software as follows:We're having an unusual problem on our NT 4.0 Server running Services for Macintosh and Undelete 2.0. An example of the problem is described as follows:One of our Macintosh users has a subdirectory on the NT Server. Within this sudirectory, he has files that are periodically replaced by newer files of the same name. When attempting to overwrite the file, he is asked to confirm the file replacement. Answering affirmatively, the file is appropriately replaced. HOWEVER, within a minute, the updated file disappears.Executive Software replied to the problem by acknowledging that there were known issues with Macintosh files and Undelete. Their solution was to exclude Macintosh volumes from Undelete operations. They also indicated that they hoped to have the problem resolved in a future build of the software although there was no ETA on such a build.In our network, which is 40% Macintosh, Undelete is more of a problem than a resolution.

If you're a serious MIDIhead, for example, LE's limitations are a downer. Download the 30-day demo and be sure it'll do what you need it to ... or else you're out $300. Of course you can upgrade to PRO. If LE's limitations were out in the open ... or you already had experience with PRO ... you could more easily decide whether to purchase it.Logic is a complex program, with a steep learning curve, and maybe some of LE's limitations were intended to make it less complex.

None of the books dedicated to PRO is well-written enough to save you lots of time.On the plus side, LE handles audio well, and includes many useful plugs, including virtual instruments (some, again, limited).

You can view your CSS styles incase you forgot what it looked like very much as you would a font in Microsoft Word 2000. The pallets are more intuitive and takes a slight adjustment to get used to from MX. Dreamweaver MX 2004 also has more robust features with added internal extensions to make your code bank stronger.

B0001BG1NI,8/9,4.0,"I bought this product based on my research of users opinions and found it has lived up to their high opinions. I have boxes of family photos as well as numerous camcorder tapes of family events. I wanted an easy comprehensive program that would let me arrange photos and video clips, add music and burn on a DVD. This program does it all and more. It may not do everything extremely well, but for the price, well enough to put out an impressive DVD. After about two hours of getting familiar with the program, I was able to create a DVD that had 35 pictures and a video clip with background music - stunning results. I played the DVD on several different brands of DVD players and had no problems. Looks great on TV. I've had no problems running the program on my computer - I'm running this on a Pentium IV 2.9 GHz, 1 gig ram and 200 GB ram HD. Since I am a beginner/weekend hobbyist, this suites my purpose of sharing pictures with family - I'm finding much better to share on DVD than paper photos. For an all-in-one package at this price, it does the job very well and I would recommend it.",software

B0000DIEKZ,29/43,1.0,"After I purchased Home Designer Suite 6.0, I opened the box, dropped the CD in the computer, and picked up the manual. But there was a problem. The manual that came in the box was for their $500 pro version instead of the Suite 6.0 version.Now you have got to question the competence of a software company that can't get the right manual in the box, but while they clearly screwed up, there is nothing intrinsically wrong with a them selling a crippled version of their software with features removed, and a full version as long as they clearly tell you what you are getting.Unfortunately they don't. There is nothing on the packaging of the Suite 6.0 version to let you know that it is the crippled version of the pro version.Since I had the manual for the pro version, I fliped through it to see if I might want to upgrade to the pro version right away. Fortunately the ""What's in the box"" page at the front of the pro manual let me know that I definitely did not want the pro version either.The pro version uses a hardware key that has to be plugged into either the serial port or the USB port of your computer or the software won't run. Hardware keys are a big cause of ulcers among computer users. They get in the way of your computer cables and they tend to come unplugged just before you want to save a really big file. If you ever do lose one, just try and get the software company to replace it.If you'd like to give this software a try it would be a good idea to visit the company's web page to make sure that the features included in the Suite 6.0 version will do what you you need in the long run with no upgrade ever being required. If you think that you might need the features of the pro version later, it's my experience that using software that requires a hardware key is simply not worth the bother.",software

B000H2049I,2/4,5.0,"I am not a savvy computer user but I really like this program. I have read reviews that compare it to the previous version but I believe those reviews are rather short-sighted. I compare it to not having ever used a dictation program, at all. Some of the things the program can do seem amazing. For instance, if I speak a telephone number somehow it knows it's a telephone number and puts it in telephone sequence. (XXX-XXX-XXXX) It learns amazingly quickly. I spoke the last name of a doctor (Daugherty) and it butchered it the first time so I corrected it. The second time it nailed it! I was surprised. You can do so much with only voice commands. I consider the accuracy to be amazing, even though it does not get everything right. You will certainly have to correct some of the things you dictate. Sometimes it seems that dictating is not a whole lot faster than typing but when you speak clearly and there are few mistakes, it's a breeze. I bought the program for my father and for myself. On my computer, with the supplied headset, I get great results. If you can use the headset that comes with the program you will be happy. However...My father is a quadriplegic and only has partial use of one hand. I thought the program would be a godsend for him, as he is not able to answer emails. He types with his one ""good"" finger and it is very hard for him to click a mouse. He has to use a marble mouse glued down to the desk and it's really labor-intensive for him. Enter the potential lifesaver of Dragon NaturallySpeaking. However, it is not a solution for him because he cannot put on or take off the headset. I went to the trouble to take his computer to the store and upgraded his memory to 1.5 GB and had a sound card installed. We had trouble getting the program to work so I went to the store and purchased the best desk mic I could find. (They only had two choices of desk mic at this national office-products store.) The desk mic, even though it has the latest noise-cancellation technology, is not sufficient for using the program. It is not sensitive enough and it's too far from his mouth to be of any use. He got very frustrated trying to train the program, shouting into this desk mic. He'll never use the product. In summation, if you are buying this program for a quadriplegic, reconsider the purchase if your recipient can't wear a headset microphone, as a desk mic will not work. But if you can use the headset the program can do some amazing things.",software

For all of you people who don't knowh how to read the directions or the manual given, let me give you some advice. First of all, if you're running Windows XP, you need to disable the XP firewall before you install NIS 2004. Go to my network connection, right click the connection you are currently using, go to properties, on the window that comes up, click the Advance tab, and make sure you uncheck the box. Also you might want to make sure you have no existing viruses on your computer. I know the software automatically checks for viruses before installing. If this software is giving you problems, then maybe it's your computer. Get it checked. And YES it does slow down your computer; this is because it takes up a lot of memory OFCOURSE. Upgrade your memory just as I have. That's probably the only reason I gave it 4 stars.

Don't expect to find the 100ft hill next door on the map, and don't expect to see it on the 3d mode.* I've played with it for a few hours now and it crashed once (on winXP)* There's no way to set a default directory for exporting pictures.. and it won't remember where you last exported to. Annoying.* Fire roads in state parks (Big Basin Redwoods for me) show up BARELY, but are not named. Park trails do not show up.* A lot of window boxes are &quot;modal&quot;.. meaning you can't leave the window open while viewing another window. This means that you can't compare legs of routes side-by-side. You can't compare route profiles. These are unnecessary (AFAIK) limitations in the software and should be considered bugs.* As you might expect, there are occasional inaccuracies in the map, specifically in the urban areas. The maps tend to be older sometimes, which I guess can cause these problems. Don't buy this as a reliable road map.* The CA set consists of like 12 cds. You have to insert like 5 of them and go through InstallShield for each one so that TNav knows you have the region (and haven't pirated it). You still have to insert each of the 12 cds whenever you want to view a different region. I haven't seen an option to cache the map data on hard drive instead of inserting the cds.On the positive side, this program does have really need route/waypoint features. I like being able to freehand draw over a dirt road and then view the elevation profile for the road.. You could do the same for hiking trails (if you know exactly where the trail runs!)..

B0000EI9C2,0/0,1.0,"Intuit Turbotax 2002 included a non-optional program called ""C-Dilla"". That program was supposed to be a DRM (Digital Rights Management -- anti-piracy) program, but is a particularly nasty form of spyware / malware that may be difficult or impossible to remove from your system.Before considering TurboTax, make a strong effort to find out if C-Dilla is no longer part of the TurboTax program. If C-Dilla's there... buy something else. Warning: In the 2002 version, C-Dilla's presence may NOT have been listed on the box or enclosed literature. Certainly C-Dilla's presence and activities on users' PCs were under-reported in Intuit/TurboTax's literature, making TurboTax 2002 a trojan. Intuit was not very forthcoming about how C-Dilla worked, how to remove it, etc., etc. until public pressure forced them to open up... a little.In the 2002 version of TurboTax, a great protest rose up from prominent computer-industry magazines and users, which led to Intuit/TurboTax's somewhat apologizing for C-Dilla, and offering a program that uninstalled C-Dilla after you'd uninstalled TurboTax 2002. (The original uninstall program that came with TurboTax 2002 didn't remove C-Dilla.)Why dislike C-Dilla ? Here's why.For those of you who don't know what CDilla is:It's spyware, that sits on your PC and monitors activity... not just when you use TurboTax, but ALL the time. It's also malware, because it interferes with your CD copying... not just preventing certain copyrighted CDs from being copied (OK, OK) but may also prevent your CD burner from copying CDs properly...whether there's a legitimate COPYRIGHT reason for preventing that copy or not.CDilla sets itself up on an undeclared, self-created partition on your hard disk. Yes, that means it goes in and changes your partition table !!! For some users, that's going to be a real problems, because monkeying with the partition table is NOT a good idea...particularly if you have several partitions, dedicated to several flavors of operating system (Windows and Linux, for example... with a LiLo-type partition to provide you with a boot-time menu so you can choose which operating system to boot).Here's a quote from extremetech.com. (ExtremeTech and its sister publication PC Magazine are industry leaders. You have probably heard of their most famous writer, John C. Dvorak.) This is from one of many articles there about C-Dilla, particularly C-Dilla on Intuit's TurboTax software. (Intuit-TurboTax-2002's version of C-Dilla wasn't different from any other version of C-Dilla. It just got alot of attention because TurboTax *was* very popular software until C-Dilla became a part of it.)From the article:""Likely the biggest problem users have expressed, is the level at which the TurboTax licensing agreement is managed and protected with the SafeCast/C-Dilla technology. People believe C-Dilla infiltrates their system in a very insidious manner, and uses memory and resources even when TurboTax is not loaded. And some believe it has caused them serious compatibility problems with non-related CD writing operations. (PC Magazine and ExtremeTech will be conducting some tests next week to see if we can duplicate some of these problems). [....] or your customers still looking to exit TurboTax for good, the uninstaller at this link now fully removes components of SafeCast/C-Dilla that were previously mostly impossible to remove.""You can use the search engine at extremetech.com to find this article and related C-Dilla articles, and the very interesting discussions about C-Dilla, what it does, why folks dislike it intensely, whether it can be removed from a PC, etc. etc.In short, C-Dilla is an extremely strong reason for any PC user to avoid this product until Intuit promises that C-Dilla is NOT a part of the 2003 offering. Be safe...buy something else instead. If you're planning on using this product at work, forget it... your Info Technology manager will have a cow if he/she knows that you're installing destructive trojan/spyware (C-Dilla) on the company PCs. If you've already installed this software on a PC at work, let your IT manager know IMMEDIATELY, so he/she can take whatever steps are possible to remove C-Dilla.",software

I couldn't get my Samsung 225W Monitor to work right as far as color accuracy. Things looked generally okay...but there were issues. My photos showed blown highlights, even though they printed okay. The bright reds on some programs looked blown out. I had to reduce contrast to take pink hues out and fix the blown highlights. But everything looked dull under that setting.So finally I decided to get Huey. Within 10 minutes it adjusted everything perfectly. The photos no longer have blown highlights. The reds are now true. I can adjust the brightness and contrast to my taste without affecting the colors or creating pink hues. The program guides you very well through set up. It's really a breeze. Then you can compare the corrected settings with the uncorrected settings. You can pick various pre-set adjustments (Photo Editing, Video Editing, Warm low contrast, Warm high contrast, etc.) and visually see the changes on the screen. So you know just what you're getting.The funny thing is when I look as the manual settings on the monitor controls (amount of red, green and blue; or the gamma selection, etc.) they are the same as they were before the adjustments. Huey seems to overlay its changes on the existing settings on the monitor (don't know how they do it). But it works great.Very Highly Recommended. I'd give it 6 Stars if I could.",software

I don't know what is it about this little childrens software that is so involving and somehow realistic, there's a feeling that I've travelled through the real European Continent whenever I come back from playing this game, it is absolutely delightful and one of my favorites!Madeline had planned to go to camp with other girls that day, but things quickly changed when, under some steps at the Paris Train Station, Madeline spots a magic lamp. She softly touches the lamp and it begins to glow very brightly revealing a genie, who quickly befriends Madeline. Suddenly, a shadowy figure snatches the lamp from Madeline's hands and sets off in a train. Poor Madeline is left with nothing more than a map that the thief had dropped but Genevieve accidently tears it to pieces. After this, Madeline knows she can no longer go to camp, instead, she decides to follow the thief and rescue the genie. Before she leaves Paris, however, Madeline will have to do some searching and finding in order to adquire some things she'll need.As you play, you'll be able to explore different areas in France, Switzerland, Italy and finally, Turkey, meeting all kinds of interesting and warm characters as you travel. Also part of this enchanting little adventure game are a few sets of activities. Different word games allow a child to learn over one hundred words both in Spanish and French. The game includes pictures of different European landscapes and monuments that you can color and then print out. Finally, the best one, in which you can learn about the location, flag, name and capital of nineteen different countries by doing series of matching, after each one you get right, you'll be told an interesting fact about that country. The graphics, backgrounds and animations are of the same quality as most Madeline products such as the books and the TV series, keeping it more appealing by sticking to a rather simplistic outlook. The music is pleasant and adds a very nice touch to the mood of the story, blending quite nicely with each different situation and place.This little masterpiece should be checked out by all little children, especially those who may be attached to Madeline and her adventures.

What this lets me do is install/uninstall software without the risk of destroying my Win98 installation - and without having to backup a disk, just a directory. Win4Lin installs in the user's home directory in a directory named Win. By selectively copying and renaming directories, I can keep seperate developement environments going for each of my clients, or try an installation and do a &lt;real&gt; uninstall. I have a Personal Web Server and MSSql server copy using Visual Interdev, that allows me to test under Linux without re-booting - just change desktops.While the limitations for games are well documented by reviewers, Win4Lin is outstanding for business apps - they will actually run faster and safer than on Win98 natively, when no MS file systems are used, under Linux file systems.",software

B0002X0500,7/7,1.0,"I recently purchased TV SlideShow Studio and spent many hours creating a presentation that would be shown at my daughter's wedding reception. What I found after the effort was that, despite periodically saving my work -- or so I thought -- NONE of my work was saved.Abacus Publishing's Tech Support, after waiting more than a week after I asked how to get a file to save properly, finally responded -- by noting that the problem was apparently known, and the problem would not appear in the upcoming Version 2 of the product. That, of course, did me no good whatsoever; I paid for a product that does not function properly.There are some very nice features in this product and it offers much promise, particularly given its relatively low cost. But if the presentation cannot be saved, what good does any of this do?Look elsewhere if you're seeking software to put together a presentation of your photographs.",software
B00001SVFL,18/19,5.0,"Compared to Visual C++, I'd take this anyday. I can't comment on the book that's included, as I never looked at it, but the software is the best you'll find at a price that won't kill your wallet. It doesn't have quite as many features as other programs, but these features are usually minor things, like the ability to see all DLLs which your program requires, or to package your program with an installer, and there is freeware/shareware that is available to do both of these.The weakest feature of the software is a poorly-done help file system. On the other hand, it comes with something like 50-75 fully working example programs (almost all are windows programs), which are great ways to see the tricks of the trade.I use this compiler exclusively. I've published several programs as freeware on the web, and I've found this more than meets my needs in every way.For those that are interested in the book, it ships with &quot;Sams' Teach Yourself C in 24 hours&quot;, so you can look at the reviews of that book for comments.

B00005MOTE,11/17,1.0,"The number one problem I have with this OS is it's invasive aggressive anti-piracy aspects. While I agree 100% with Microsoft about wanting to stop all the WAREZ idiots from ripping them off - and even worse from profiting from their product, I *DO NOT* think this is the way to do it!#1 you have to call or electronically register this OS and it's CD-KEY to get it to run at all.#2 If your system configuration changes too much (I.E. new RAM, new HD, New CD-ROM etc.) then the OS will freeze up again and you have to RE-register it with Microsoft, getting yet another code to enter to unlock it. And you can only do that up to 5 times before Microsoft starts to demand you provide very elaborate reasons as to why you need to install it again! (If you are like me and you tinker with your system constantly I am sure you can imagine the headache this will cause)#3 If you try to run Office XP with this OS you will have EVEN MORE registration numbers you need to put in in order to get the two suites to unlock and work together!My Second major problem with this OS is overall, it really isn't all that different than WIN98/WIN2000 or ME. It is still basically the same OS, it may be a little faster to some people running much older systems, but for people with newer systems the speed doesn't increase all that much. I would recommend more RAM for speed over a new OS *ANY DAY* anways.Does this OS have a good side? You bet! It boasts that it is WAY more stable than anything else released to date. PC WORLD Magazine even said they could get 19 APPS to run at the same time on a pentium I PC with only 128 MB RAM - without any crashes or ""blue screens of death"", that is impressive. It also has lots of nifty stuff for those of you out there that like to tinker with lots of multimedia stuff like DVDs/CDs/MP3s/Movies Etc.Bottom line, it is HARD to find anything *BUT* the latest release of Windows in the stores these days. I prefer Windows 98 SE but good luck finding a copy! If you are buying a new system that has the software and OS pre-loaded, you (...)basically (have) no options anyway.

B0000CAVRR,0/0,1.0,"I've been an avid Flash developer since version 4.0. I had high hopes for this version but I'm extremely disappointed, even angry, with Macromedia for releasing one of the worst programs I've ever had to use.Like many Macromedia products, they had a great vision but apparently no quality control department. Macromedia software has always been a little buggy when compared to other vendors, but this one really goes over the line. Their concept was to make Flash the defacto standard for creating rich internet applications (RIA's). If they had delivered what they intended, this would truly have been a wonderful program. But unfortunately this version is too riddled with bugs and performance issues to be of much use.I did like the upgrade to the scripting language, ActionScript 2.0. The language is now very similar to Java. You can use public and private modifiers (no protected). You can create classes and interfaces, and &quot;extend&quot; and &quot;implement&quot; classes and interfaces. It's also an (optionally) typed language, though type checking is only performed at compile time -- still extremely useful.Aside from the language upgrade, the documentation in this program is horrible. The components are buggy and bloated. The program sucks memory, crashes frequently, and it takes forever to export a movie.If you are interested in the upgrade to ActionScript 2.0, get the reguler (non-professional) version of Flash MX 2004. The extra &quot;features&quot; of the Pro version are not worth a dime.",software

I think the intuitiveness of the program increases by the version too - can't wait to get PS 7 and that internal file manager! The ability to colorsynch with other Adobe software such as InDesign is great and it makes life a lot easier, another reason for choosing Adobe over Jasc (Paint Shop Pro) or any other software producer.

B003L20ICO,1/1,4.0,"The Kids Are All Right is a story about two lesbian moms that basically live like a normal family raising their kids. Well the comedy comes in the way they interact with, not only each other, but their own children whenever the kids ask them questions pertaining to their sexual preferences.This is done in a way that seems inoffensive and harmless (though I suppose it's up for interpretation whether it really is or not) and there's actually some pretty clever scenes such as, for example, the two moms questioning their sons sexual preferences and automatically assuming that he's chosen a man and that he has some explaining to do when the one mom accidentally walked into his bedroom and noticed he was watching male pornography on his computer, however it turns out the male porn belonged to the two moms so THEY were actually the ones who had to explain it, lol. I'm referring to the kitchen scene near the beginning. It's hilarious! Talk about turning the tables!Anyway the storyline is about the kids wanting to find their biological father (the sperm doner) so they do a little searching and when they find him... well it turns out he's doing pretty good for himself and gets along with the kids but I wouldn't call it a GREAT relationship. As the one mom accurately says, ""he's too self-satisfied"" and believes in doing things his own way which can easily be interpreted as ""the lazy way"" or ""his way or the highway"".Eventually we discover that the one mom has a thing for this man, so they find sneaky ways to hide their sexual relationship through a supposed ""back yard decoration chore"" that the mom volunteered for, even though it's pretty obvious to the people working in the back yard that some hanky panky is taking place between the mom and the sperm doner, lol. This relationship is what begins the increase in quality for me. Before this... I'd say the movie wasn't really anything special. Now however, they have to keep this knowledge hidden from the moms lesbian partner.I had to take one point away because there's some mild downtime in the beginning when really nothing of interest happens. No character or storyline development takes place for several minutes at a time, and the discussion between the biological father and his kids was alright but occasionally the victim of hit-or-miss in the jokes department. The second half of the movie when the one mom suspects the other one of cheating on her, along with the Joni Mitchell dinner table sing-along segment (and I'll have them know I'm a straight man who loves Joni's music!) is another noteworthy segment.Overall, the Kids Are All Right is funny and it's even touching (especially near th end when the daughter goes off to college). Most importantly -and the reason I watched it in the first place- it's just plain different. I prefer originality so having a lesbian couple raise their children was definitely a new storyline feature to me. Great movie.",software

Imagine saying the words in the correct order but the program doesn't recognize the sentence, instead showing you what is incorrect but apparently uncorrectable.The second biggest problem is that the dictionary/translation tool rarely works when needed. Leaving you to guess instead of discover what a word or sentence means or the context it is being used in. There is no option to translate entire sentences.The grammar tool often gives a different explanation than the one sought. How many times I have seen the explanation that sometimes pronouns are capitalized for emphasis when I needed to know a conjugation or something else is ridiculously high.The CD's are OK but definitely not stand alone.

Telephone support for any issue is available at $19.99 per call. The company basically tells you to use their web support. The would be a usable solution if their web support site were well-implemented. It is not.Dataviz provides no way to search all the problems related to a specific product. This is speculation on my part, but I suspect the reason may be because of the great number of bugs inherent to most Dataviz products. Dataviz suggests using a specific error message, error number or file and component name. This, of course, renders support useless when you have a general question that is not covered in the scanty Frequently Asked Questions section. (For amusement, I entered the word ""problem"" as a search term for Documents To Go Premium 8 support and the search engine returned 724 hits. Not very encouraging.)Dataviz makes reaching the company by e-mail incredibly difficult. You have to wade through several screens to get to a point where you can initiate an e-mail. They don't publish support addresses. You are forced to once again use their braindead search engine and then have to supply a number of system parameter for even the simplest question that may not require such information.I've rarely seen such a hostile attitude toward the customer. I'll be looking for more user friendly vendors of products that perform the similar functions. Dataviz just isn't worth the hassle of dealing with - - - the only time they exhibit a friendly face to the user is when they want their money.Jerry",software

B000AOGDM0,484/489,4.0,"The bad news first: The map details are still not as good as were found in the 2004 version of this program. I can't understand why MS would dumb down their product. Also, the street names seem to have been dumbed down as well. For example, Golden Eagle Ferry Road has been reduced to Ferry Road. There are innumerable examples of this dumbing down and simpifying which only serves to confuse.The good news: The GPS functionality has been vastly improved with voice and large visual prompts which make using the program in an automobile MUCH MUCH easier. The little car cursor in the 2005 version has been replaced by a much more visible circle with a large arrow in it indicating direction.Despite the dumbing down of the actual map data the program remains a superb mapping program with many updates since the 2004 and 2005 versions. New streets, restaurants and other points of interest are now incorporated. This program offers a truly affordable GPS guidance system for nearly all consumers without having to go to the expensive Garmin or Magellan systems. If you find yourself traveling to points unknown I cannot imagine a better solution for getting around than this product in conjunction with your notebook.A few comments about the Streets and Trips mapping software. I am familiar with the Delorme product and the Garmin product and Streets and Trips blows them both away - no contest. Instantaneous panning, zooming in and zooming out, outstanding routing software, and a plethora of other features makes Streets and Trips, by far, my favorite mapping software.One problem I had, and hopefully this will help others who might encounter the same problem: Downloading the software into your computer does NOT automatically load the drivers for the GPS locator device! This must be done separately with the Setup disk when you first attach the locator device. Should you fail to put the Setup disk in and let your computer find the driver automatically ON THAT DISK, then your program will not recognize the locator! I wasted quite a bit of time trying to figure out what was wrong. If you don't add the drivers manually your device manager will automatically load drivers that will not be recognized by the program! I had to go into my Device Manager and uninstall the drivers that were added and then manually install the MS drivers for the GPS locator. Not an insurmountable problem, but it does require a bit of experience with computers.The included driver software turns your USB port into a pseudo-serial communication port enabling the software to recognize the locator (only serial ports are recognized by the software). The software will not recognize the locator UNLESS it is attached to a serial (or in this case pseudo-serial) communications port. So be careful and follow the installation instructions closely. The locator is made by Pharos GPS and if you have any installation problems go to their web site for further instructions.I heartily recommend this product however be aware of the minor software and driver glitches I've described above. All in all, I think you will be VERY pleased.",software

B0007TITAW,10/11,4.0,"Okay, i didn't want to buy a logo software, since I already had Paint Shop Pro 8.0 and my plain but-trusty Microsoft Paint Program, which I use for all graphics needs. So I decided to put my own art skills and creativity to the test using graphics programs to create my logo, instead hiring somebody to do it for me (spending a ton of money and I might even like it as much as if i do it myself!).I was able to put together a few logo ideas with those graphic programs of mine, but it TOOK SO LONG, it WAS NOT POLISHED AND CLEAN, I WISH THERE WERE LOGO-LIKE TEMPLATES. I bought a few cheaper logo softwares (under $50 range), and this software was the best out of all of them.I would not call this a 99 cent type of logo software. There's far worse than this. The good points about this one compared to other crappier software IMO:- Sharp looking templates- Templates offer a wide variety of colors- Templates do not look cheap and drawn out, or way too flashyMind you, I was going for a ""large corporation look"", rather than a cheap, low-budget, internet start-up look. So this program really had the style to accomplish this objective of mine.(The other software had a lot of flashy templates, where you could create logos for perhaps a bar or nightclub down the street, not for a professional company that would to be respected by serious clients.)As far as a software to help me brainstorm ideas, and easily put together and test out a wide range of colors and shapes, that come out looking clean, sharp, and refined...the software really eased my ability to do so. The other graphics programs (however good for pictures and drawings and other applications), were not designed specifically or making logos... thus they took a lot longer and ended up being less clean and polished than what this logo software could produce in a lot less time.I'm glad I shelled out the $30 i did to help me develop my very own logo with my own mind and bare hands. If you care about your company, but still are on a budget, and want something that will pop out prospective logos easily (and let you tweak all your ideas easily) this would be worth the $30.",software

Microsoft Office XP programs now offer (finally) multiple highlighting so to save time and effort. Mail merge is now easier and the clipboard now holds more. Individuals will now be pleased that the paper clip will now be eradicated with the much delight from myself and other individuals and to curtail the times of swearing at it. However, individuals can still turn it on if you still miss it or use it. Overall, Microsoft Office XP is a welcome piece of software and with voice-recognition (for the times when typing too much is a strain or you can not be bothered) then it is here to stay, until the next version of Microsoft Office. However, there are a few setbacks on the improvements of Microsoft Outlook Express and of Smart Tags in some programs not as comprehensive as in Microsoft Word but these should not be a problem really in the long term. Microsoft Office XP Professional Plus Version contains every Microsoft Office application that I use from Microsoft Excel to Microsoft Publisher; these programs will get you on top of your work. For more information of Microsoft Office XP, there is a demonstration of it's features... Flash is required even though a non-flash version is available.",software

B000FK88JK,0/0,5.0,"I received Mac OS X Leopard as a Christmas present. After reading some of the angst on the Apple boards and here on Amazon, I was very anxious about the upgrade and thought about waiting a few months before installing it. However, after backing up every file I could think of, I took the plunge and did a straight upgrade. To my relief, the upgrade on my iMac (2.16 GHz Intel with 2 GB Ram) came off without even a hick-up. All my old settings were preserved, and all the programs I use are working just fine. I use imail, safari, itunes, ical, imovie HD, i-photo and basically all the native Mac software that comes with a Mac has been working just fine, as have Word and Excel. I also have Parallels installed (version 2.5 with the latest version update- build 3214) and to my surprise, it came online without any problems. I'm in the midst of making a documentary movie and all the various components- movie files, photos, sound, music, voice overs are working together just like on Tiger. So, the upgrade came off splendidly!So far, my favorite feature is Quick Look, being able to quickly peak into movie files, photos and pdf's without having to fire up the native application is a pleasure- and it is fast! The time machine is really cool to watch, I can imagine that it will become a new favorite when it has the opportunity to save my hide some day. I just sent out a couple of emails using the cool stationary templates (they let you drop photos into dropzones) and the Windows using recipients got a taste of the eye-candy we get to play with on our Macs.

B0000DBOA5,23/25,4.0,"It's all about control. Now you have the photo editing control power in your hands with Adobe Photoshop CS.Raw format allows photographers greater latitude in how they want their pictures to appear. Open the camera raw image files. Next, quickly apply adjustments such as exposure compensation or tonal adjustments without compressing the image or losing any of the original image data.Shoot photos in your digital camera's raw format when image quality is the most important factor. Raw format saves all related image data with no in-camera processing.Photoshop CS allows photographers to:Control their raw camera imagesView live histograms as they workCreate lens blur effectsSimulate photo filter effectsEasily correct exposure problemsQuickly replace colorAutomatically crop and straighten photos and Create Adobe Photoshop CS panoramasThe 'Inner Core' of Adobe Photoshop CSMost of my Photoshop CS work is done in the Browser. I single-click the photos that I need for my Photoshop CS project. Now I have a group of highlighted photos that can be used in the Browser's Automated menu.The inner core of the Photoshop CS Browser's Automated menu contains: Batch, PDF Presentation, Contact Sheet II and Online Services. Also, Automated menu contains Photomerge, Picture Package and Web Photo Gallery. Running these automated menu tasks from the File Browser saves me a lot of time. I can avoid opening each photo file separately in Photoshop CS.The Photoshop CS Browser has Sort capabilities that contains the Filename, Flag, Rank, Width and Height. Also, Sort capabilities that contains File Size, Resolution, File Type and Color Profile. Finally, the Photoshop Browser's Sort contains Date Created, Date Modified, Copyright and Custom. You can sort them in ascending or descending order.Photoshop CS Photomerge and PDF PresentationsIn Photomerge, I can make a collage of photos and move them in any order. Also, I can take several sections photos of a large bridge using a tripod. I then take the section photos and join them together with Photoshop CS' Photomerge. I still have to edit the new Photomerge photo for length, size and contrast.In PDF Presentation, I can turn my photos into Acrobat PDFs and stitch them together. The fun is turning my new creation into a slideshow with various transitions. The PDF Presentation is cross-platform that can be used on a Mac and Windows computers.The 'Outer Core' of Adobe Photoshop CSThe epiphany moment for me was using Adobe Photoshop Toolbar's one-key letter shortcuts. During an SIG (Special Interest Group) meeting on how to use Adobe Photoshop, the SIG teacher showed the club members the basic one-key letter shortcuts.Keyboard CommandsThe one-key letter shortcuts that I use quite often is M for Marquee, V for Moving objects, T for Text, I for Eyedropper and C for Crop. There is a multitude of Toolbox one-key letter shortcuts that you can use or change.Toolbox uses the Shift bar to get to related tools on the same pop-out menu. For example, to cycle through the Lasso, Polygonal Lasso, and Magnetic Lasso tools, hold down Shift bar and keep pressing &quot;L&quot; key.Change Keyboard Commands in Photoshop CSThis means that missing Photoshop CS Menu keyboard commands can now be added. For example, I am constantly making changes to my images by changing the photos' contrast and brightness.Now without using the computer mouse, I use the Command, Control, and C keys in unison. Like a piano chord, I can now change the contrast and brightness in my digital photographs. I use Command, Control, and letter keys for adding keyboard commands. This works well within the menus and plugin filters that I use in Photoshop CS.Pro ReactionPhotoshop CS offers flexibility and nondestructive editing. Photoshop's Welcome screen and improved Help ease the learning curve for new users. The Help menu is changeable. I find Photoshop CS' Help menu an excellent way to learn the various functions of Photoshop program. Photoshop CS comes with a paper, hardcopy paper manual.Con ReactionYou have to read and work with hardcopy paper manual. Photoshop CS is not compatible with older Mac OS. Photoshop CS requires Mac OS X 10.2.4 or greater.Final WordsPhotoshop is the industry standard for professional photo editing, graphic design, and digital imaging. Adobe Photoshop is considered the industry standard. Photoshop skills are required for employment in the graphic design field.Digital photographers will benefit from Adobe Photoshop with its strong digital-camera raw workflow.

B000EEZ2QE,2/3,4.0,"I have a Garmin LMT 1450. Unfortunately there is not enough memory built into the GPS to hold these maps and the US, so I got the SD card. I installed it before I went on my trip to the UK/Ireland and the maps came up, no problemo. However, I ran into problems when I tested it again in London prior to driving the following week in Scotland. It would not synch with the satellites. I check for a solution online and found that I needed a clear view of the sky. I walked to a park and waited until the battery ran out without any luck.I then called Garmin UK support and was told that I had to clear all user data if I wanted the unit to work in Europe. And I would have to do that again when I went back to the US. This would cause the Garmin to find the local satellites. Unfortunately your home address and recently found locations are erased as well. This information is not sent with the maps and should be!Here is the procedure on my unit, look at your manual under Erase User Data to find out your secret way to reset the Garmin to the local satellites:1. Turn off your Nuvi.2. Hold your finger on the lower right corner of the Nuvi screen while turning on the Nuvi. Keep your screen finger pressed until the pop up window appears. May take 30 seconds, so be patient with that finger. You will be prompted whether do you really want to erase all user data, or asked if do you really want to start up in maintenance mode.3. Press ""Yes"" to clear all user data.I did that and when the unit came back on it synched up in about 10 minutes or so. After that it behaved as it did in the US, usually ready almost immediately.So how was the map experience? Very, very good. Literally all roads but one came up and that was a fairly new 20 mile section of expressway in Ireland. It almost always took us the fast way. The arrival time estimates were always too optimistic as the posted speeds on those small roads in Scotland and Ireland were begging for a head on accident. Often the speed limit was 60 mph on a two way road with blind turns, overgrown stone walls on both sides and farm tractors zipping your way.Roundabout directions were very good with a lot of advance notice. ""Roundabout in one half mile."" Sometimes a roundabout had a blocked road that had never been finished and you had to guess whether to count it when it told you to, ""Enter roundabout and take third exit.""A couple of tips for roundabouts.1. Most large roundabouts have two lanes going in. If the unit tells you to take the second or third exit, it is usually better to be in the right lane, because the left lane is often dedicated to the first exit.2. It is pretty reliable to count the exits to get the right one using the Garmin. But a good double check is to glance at your unit (or ask your copilot) and see what road you should be taking next as you exit the roundabout. The roundabouts are incredibly well signed with very clear arrows. Just look for the arrow going towards the road the Garmin tells you to be on, count the exits and take the one leading to your next road. Piece of cake even in large cities.We drove in Edinburg, Dublin, Galway, etc. and felt comfortable that the unit worked well and the maps were almost 100% correct.We found one major error as the unit could not find Bunratty, a popular little town in Ireland. (Best Irish coffee ever at the Bunratty Hotel! and try the Lamb Stew at Durty Nelly's pub across the street from the Castle.)Also, I did not find how to enter latitude/longitude coordinates into our system. I suggest you figure that out because many small hotels or B&Bs; don't have addresses you can enter. Often they use a nearby town and perhaps a road. Or their websites will list the lat/long.Overall these maps greatly reduced our stress level about driving in the UK.",software

B00029SRBI,1/2,5.0,"In this game, you are a submarine sort of thing. You get to navigate your way through the ocean reefs to find little message capsules that will eventually lead you to a ship that needs assistance (?). I have never finished the game, but then again, it takes a long time. It's lots of fun, though. You have an air supply, and every time you hit a fish, or something shooting from a fish, or certain plants and parts of the 'walls', then you loose air. You get air at the beginning of every level, and you can get extra if you touch a dolphin with an air pack on its back. Every once and a while you will have to answer a question, most (all?) of the time involving math. If you get it wrong, you loose air. Also, you have ink balls to throw at fish and plants that with keep them away from you while you go past. As the levels progress, it's harder to navigate to get all the capsules, the math questions are harder, and there are more difficult fish you have to get by.So it's not a character or adventure game, it's a learning game, but it's fun.

Jay-Lo plays the un-lucky bride-to-be-flattened, a beautiful yet self-supporting character who doesn't fall for Fonda's tricks easily yet can't keep from going to war with her. The script posits the two as opposite forces of nature doomed to battle til death do they part. Along the way, the story throws a few curves their way - an ugky dress for Fonda, an allergy for Jay-Lo, an actor who claims to be a psychiatrist and a not-so-surprising visit from Fonda's mother in law.""Monster"" is a montser of a movie, and not in the good way. The story forces every joke - rams it down your throat. For a big flcik, the movie is conspicuously unamusing and unentertaining - there isn't a single decent joke in the movie, nor a plot turn that you won't spot a mile away. Worst of all i sthe part of Fonda's personal...assistant, Ruby. Played ernestly by Wanda Sykes, the character is meant top embody the disbelief that rational people would have on witnessing the acts of the protagonists. It's like the writers knew that nobody would buy their uninspired mess of a story, so they hedged their bet and crafted a character that would mirror their disbeleief first - as if that woukd distract people from registering their skpeticism by having somebody do it for them. ""Monster"" is like the unentertaining sequel to a more sincere hit - the kind of movie that studios feel they have to make as a follow-up to a more decent movie. (But even botched sequels offer the memory to their better predecessors - the best we can say for ""Monster"" is that there won't be a sequel.)

GUI is not intuitive enough. Maybe the hardware I used for installations caused troubles for Linux (PC Micron Millenia XKU 128M produced 1997.), whatever it is either I could not have the sound but have high speed internet (always with some tweaking and adjusting, I even had to learn about STREAM drivers and modules to get things going!), or I could have sound but no internet etc. etc. Linux support told me the problem was in hardware?! But machine works perfectly on all versions of Windows including XP. It appeared that NO Linux distro can handle sharing IRQ and resources in general (Windows can!). So if you have a PC few years old but with not many IRQs free (for whatever the reason) and you want to install Linux - then you are in big trouble (I spent months resolving these issues with Linux).Finally, regarding stability, I am now using Windows2000 service pack 1 and I must say this is ULTIMATE in stability and reliability.

Quite frankly, it is more challenging than Studio 10 to learn, but after a short adjustment period of learning the ins and outs of Sony's software, it's a Godsend over the clunky functionality of Studio 10.Feature-wise, Sony and Pinnacle both brought comparable products to the market with Sony having a slight edge in some features that come with it out of the box you HAVE TO PAY EXTRA FOR in the Pinnacle suite.The only advantage Pinnacle has is in it's DVD creation feature. With Sony's product, you need to export your movies to an MPEG and a WAV file and open a separate program to create your DVD. The creation of a menu system, while not as robust as Pinnacle's method, is a lot more stable on the final DVD than Pinnacle's. I made one DVD with pinnacle where the menu didn't work properly from one player to another whereas all discs I made with Sony did work correctly on all players I tried it on.My advice, just avoid Pinnacle and go right for Sony's Vegas Movie Studio + DVD.

By consolidating the Accept/Change for downloaded transactions in the live check register, the designers of this product have created a basically fatal flaw in the software which now has left me showing ""1 Transaction to Review"" but its not in the register (and I can no longer see it on the downloaded statement as you could with earlier versions of Money to find it). Apparently because of this flaw, I can no longer download current statements from the bank! I've used Money for 4 years now with different versions, the best was Money 2000; this is by far the worst. Both my wife and I who have been Money fans up to this point, are very unhappy with this release of Microsoft Money. DON'T BUY OR UPGRADE TO THIS RELEASE OF MICROSOFT MONEY!!!

B000HKIM7Q,5/6,5.0,"WOW!! This is truly a dream come true for me. I was born in the early 70's. I came to love Spiderman in the early 80's, but the misfortune of having been born more than 10 years after his first inception proved to be most prohibitive in terms of collecting every comic book he was in. Even as much as I loved reading Spiderman, the cost of trying to go back and get every back issue today would be astronomical in cost.No longer!!! I am now able to read every Amazing Spiderman comic without having to have an actual hard copy! It's also interesting to see how the art work for Spiderman has evolved over the past 40 years and even more interesting to see how the ads have changed--strange side note, I know, but you can see how the marketing for the target audience hasn't changed much!By the way, if you DO have the misfortune (like the previous reviewer) of having Roxio Easy Media Creator 8, then you will realize that you can only look at the 1960's folder. However, there is a simple, although sloppy, FIX -- simply boot up your computer in SAFE MODE and you will be able to view the rest of the folders. If you tire of doing that every single time, you can have the DVD copied over to your own hard drive so that you can view them at your leisure.The other fix is to simply uninstall Roxio Easy Media Creator.

B000GHV6N2,8/11,5.0,"Ok, so CNet gave this an outstanding review, but the reviews here, user reviews, and the forum ALMOST scared me off of this product entirely. A little about me: moderate to advanced computer user, work in technology, under 30, have been doing my finances on a self-managed set of excel spreadsheets and calendar for SEVEN YEARS. I have a system. I liked it. However, I was tired of manually creating it month after month, and ready to try automating it.Now, I understand entirely if you are a Quicken user, and you are downright ANGRY at the support and bugs. It's buggy. Believe it. And from what I've heard, I hope I NEVER have to use their tech support. But after a day of use, setting up all my accounts, and LOVING the calendar technology, I am absolutely a fan. Yes, it's crashed. And I can imagine the frustration of other users, but my accounts synched virtually without a hitch. I had a better financial picture in an hour than I've had off my sheets in years. I absolutely adore the calendar function. If you are like me, and about 70% of the women in this country living virtually paycheck to paycheck regardless of take-home income, seeing the calendar cash flow is critical. I want to know in a glance when I will be having problems in the month, when I could potentially drain my checking and start tapping into that hard-scraped savings. Plus, a recent viewing of Suze Orman's ""Women & Money"" has me determined to open a few grown up accounts and save for retirement. I need to know how realistic my budget goals are, and when to begin the process. This tool will definitely help me optimize and manage more efficiently.So, I know I may not be popular with the die-hard Quicken users out there, but all I can say is don't forget what made you fall in love with this tool and choose it in the first place. It just isn't that bad if you don't have to upgrade from an older version. It IS a better tool than Money, I'm convinced after using their trial for 60 days and ditching it. They support their products synching a full year longer than money does. PLUS, no cheesy Microsoft Passport ID to access the online synching (I know, I know, I don't technically have to provide it, but I don't want to have to download my transactions people. I expect the software to do it.). I really do hope they clean the bugs up in the next edition, they really are unacceptable, but I have really nothing else to complain about here - I think it's a stellar program that's light years beyond the stilted interface of Microsoft.",software

B00005OP3C,19/23,4.0,"I bought my Garmin E Trex Vista on the recommendation of the salesman, telling me that I can &quot;hook it up to my computer, and download maps&quot;. Even the manual that came with the GPS gave a quick blurb about adding their MapSource software to add &quot;detailed map data&quot; to the very limited map that's built-into the unit. So I investigated both the Topo maps, and Recreational maps at the Garmin website, and both seemed quite a bit more detailed, even though my favorite lake looked only like a rough representation, with only one hill. Then I checked out Map Tech, and the detail was ten-fold! It showed every little slope, and accurately depicted every inch of the shoreline, so I bought it. The only glitch I noticed, was that the cursor on the map is supposed to show elevation, but if you follow one line thats supposedly following a contour, it's plus or minus 15 feet as you scroll, and when I pointed at the lake, then at a thirty foot hill, it showed the same elevation between the two, where the field right next to it accurately showed every foot difference of elevation But when I tried downloading the maps into my Garmin Vista, I found the only thing you can transfer back and forth between the GPS and computer were waypoints, tracks, and routes. So all I could download were little dots on that screen, which shows my lake as a blank field. Garmin Website tells me the only GPS units that accept map upgrades, (Mapsource only), are the GPS12 Map, GPS III+, E-Map, GPS Map 295, and the Street Pilot. I guess all I can do with the MapTech is print the maps to carry to the field, lug my lap-top with me on a hike, or buy a handheld, but someone else wrote that his Compaq works,but not Palm? All I wanted was a small GPS, which I could take on a hike, and have it show me very detailed maps, so I could find the best routes, and I'd never have to worry about getting lost.

B00005MOTE,18/21,4.0,"After using NT for some time in a production environment I was happy to see that its technology finally made it to Microsoft's desktop OS (it's about time!). Since I hadn't purchased an OS in a long time I was reluctant to part with $100 for a set of features I felt should have been there in the first place. But, I was having terrible stability problems with Windows ME so I decided to go for it, and I am very happy with my decision.Installation:-------------The box sat on my desk for a few days while I contemplated if I really wanted to go through with the upgrade. I figured something would fail and I would be left with a crippled system. Finally I decided to go for it. I booted the upgrade CD and it could never find a copy of Windows on my system (Windows ME was installed). This seemed like a bad sign, but I pressed on. I ended up running the update from within Windows and everything worked fine. The update wizard was clear about which programs and hardware were not compatible. After that the installation was a breeze - completely hands off. Once it was done the machine rebooted and I was running XP. I was very impressed with the ease of the upgrade process.I had no problems with applications running under XP. Well, naturally the applications that weren't compatible didn't magically work J. Anyway, even games worked just fine.Usability/New Features:-----------------------There really isn't too much here, but the few changes do make a difference. First, and most obvious, is the new interface. It operates much like the old one with some cosmetic enhancements and usability enhancements to areas like the control panel. New users will find the system friendlier.Overall, more functionality is integrated into XP. For example, browsing through folders offers many new features. If you are looking at a folder full of pictures you practically have the functionality of a full picture-viewing program at your disposal. It reminded me of features seen in the KDE project (a *nix desktop environment) to provide robust functionality in the file manager.Finally, coming from a Unix background, I love the ability to theme the desktop. If you look around the net you'll find XP themes based on your favorite *nix window manager themes. On top of that, the PowerToys package (available for download from Microsoft) allows for a traditional Unix-like ""focus follows mouse"" policy. Finally! JRecommendations:----------------If you are using Windows 95, 98 or ME I highly recommend making the investment in XP. It is worth every penny just for the stability alone.Before updating your system, grab the latest XP drivers for all of your hardware. This makes it much easier to get your system running optimally once the update has taken place.Don't bother converting your filesystem to NTFS unless you reformat your drive. From what I've read on Usenet, it seems that when you convert to NTFS, the filesystem isn't optimally configured and actually results in rather degraded performance. Most people seem to recommend reformatting your drive if you are going to convert to NTFS. If you are thinking about doing this, make sure to read through some bulletin boards so you understand what you are getting in to and the tradeoffs involved.Oh, why 4 stars? First, the copy protection scheme is an annoyance. I can only imagine the problems that will arise as my system changes or if I get a new system. Second, the security issues are a real concern.",software

Boring.There is a bug: the challenge movies freeze and won't work and the computer feaks out. :(The best thing(and funniest)thing that happened on this game was when my brother put a naked lego guy in a tiny cage and we watched him try to get out.

B000O39RFM,21/23,5.0,"Everyone hates doing backups. I know I do. Like most utility software packages, products like this are ignored until it is too late, and your precious data is gone. It's funny how diligent I was at work (I suppose my job being at stake had something to do with it...), yet I almost never backed up anything at home. I've been playing the odds for a lot of years, and have so far been pretty lucky.The reality is that because nothing has happened, you get lulled into a false sense of security. When it finally does happen (drive crash, deleted a vital file, etc.), the cries of anguish are deafening. Again, it's never happened to me, but that doesn't mean it won't at the most inopportune moment possible, because that's how these things go. That's why I urge all of you out there in internetland to get yourself some backup software and one of those amazingly cheap external hard drives. There has never been a better time to buy one of these USB 2.0 packages of storage goodness. When you can by a 500 gigabyte drive (that's half a terabyte!) for under $125.00, and 120 giggers for around 50 bucks, there's absolutely no reason in the world not to embark on a solid backup plan right this very minute. Can't afford an external drive even at these prices? Most of your Macs probably have a CD and maybe even a DVD burner. A CD burner can put up to 700 megabytes on a disk, and a DVD burner, around 4.5 gigabytes (almost 9 GB on the double-layer disks). You know, these nice internal and external hard drives are coming down in price for a reason--they're built more cheaply, and are likely to fail more unpredictably than drives of the past. It might last 20 years, or it might go out in a blaze of glory tomorrow.Data Backup 3.0 from Prosoft Engineering is a terrific backup program. It supports nearly every kind of media: CD, DVD, hard drives, network drives, and I'm sure even more. It's a real bargain at $59.00.Installation is a breeze. It uses Apple's ""package"" method of installation. Just double-click the Data Backup.pkg file, answer a few questions, and it installs in a flash.Help comes in the form of a detailed and well-illustrated 45 page file that opens when you select Help from the Help menu.I decided to use my dual 2.0 GHz G5 PowerMac tower as my test subject. It has the optional 400 GB drive, so there's a lot to back up, though not as bad as it might seem, because I am not backing up the operating system or applications. I have the original media for those, so it seemed wasteful to back them up too, although you can if you want to.That said, Data Backup 3.0 also gives you handy pre-written backup scripts so you can back up:When you launch Data Backup 3.0, this is what the initial screen will look like, though without a volume name where you want to backup your files to.Setup is pretty basic. I won't dwell on the preferences, as you probably won't need to go in there, and if you do, the Help file will guide you through what you might need to do.If you want to keep things really simple, you won't even need to do much more than what you see in this initial screen, except for one teeny little thing--you need to tell Data Backup 3.0 where you want your backed up files to go: disk, network drive, or CD/DVD.If it's a local disk or a network volume, go to the File>Set Default Destination menu item. I have chosen my external 500 gigabyte hard drive, originally named as 500 Gigger. Click the Select button and choose your drive. If you want to back up to a network volume, first you will need to mount your network volume as you normally would from the finder. It will show as an option when you click the Select button. When you have made your selection, click the Set button. The pull-down menu items under Quick Backup get named with your backup volume.Now, it's just a matter of selecting the Quick Backup option you want. In this example, I am backing up my User files. Select All User Files to /Volumes/500 Gigger, and click the Start Now button. That's all there is to it. Really. It takes less time to just do it than it did to read the description. The screen below is what it looks like when the backup starts.If you want to back up to CDs or DVDs, Data Backup 3.0 can do that, too, prompting you to insert a new disk when the one in the burner fills up. This is probably the best solution for files you really can't afford to lose, so you can get them onto convenient media, and then move them to a safe place away from your computer (a fire- and theft-resistant safe, a safe deposit box, a data archival center, etc.). Sure, you can do this with external hard drives, but that gets a little more expensive. From the Quick Backup menu, make your backup choice: iPhoto or Document files to CD/DVD.When you click the Start Now button, the screen below pops up, prompting you to insert a CD or DVD.You can also schedule when you perform your backups. Click the Schedule (calendar) icon on the main screen. The first screen that appears the one you use to set selected dates for backups. You can also choose an interval (every n minutes, hours, days, or weeks), starting at a designated time, selected events (backup at system startup, or when a destination or source volume appears on the system), or simply which days of the week do you want to back up, at a given time. The more automatic you make things, the more likely you will be to actually use it.There, easy to do backups that if you did nothing else, you would have safely preserved data from your system to a secondary storage place, so if the unthinkable happened, you'd still have your data.But wait, there's more! See that Show Backup Options triangle? That's where the real power of Data Backup 3.0 is hidden. Basically, if you don't need to do any more than what I described above, you don't need to go into the options. If you're like me, who has stuff stashed on multiple disks and maybe on network drives, and who knows what else, you will need this power.Click the little triangle next to Show Backup Options and you will see what I mean.In this window, you can choose more data sources to back up by clicking the ""+"" symbol in the Sources part of this window. It permits you to select complete volumes or just some folders on different volumes, or maybe folders not stored within your /Users folder. You can also select multiple destinations for your backed up files by adding more volumes or folders to the Destination field. The Destination Type pull-down lets you select Volumes or CD/DVD for backups.There are extensive ""rules"" that can be applied for backing up files, which can be found in the Rules tab (see above). Data Backup 3.0 is also scriptable, using Automator.Data Backup 3.0 can compress your backup files to make room for more backups and other files on your backup volume, and if you have sensitive information, you can encrypt your backups. There have been a ton of articles in the paper lately about personal information getting disseminated because backup tapes were stolen, and they were not encrypted. Well, here's your chance to protect your backup files (and maybe your job, if you are using this product for business). This program is so smart that a Preferences setting even automatically powers up your computer, performs the backup, and shuts it down again. Speaking of business (or for multi-computer families), Prosoft offers attractive multiuser licenses, too. Check out their product page at http://www.prosoftengineering.com/products/data_backup.php for complete pricing information.With its default settings, a newer version of a file will overwrite the older version. In the Data Backup>Preferences menu, you can set Data Backup to perform more sophisticated Full/Incremental backups, where only the newer or replaced files are backed up, and older versions of files are retained in the backup archive. The Backup Type pull-down offers many backup methods: Simple Copy, Clone (make a bootable copy of your hard drive), Versioned, Full, Incremental, and Synchronize. Read the excellent online help manual for descriptions of each type and the advantages/disadvantages of each one. You can also download the version 2.1 manual at http://www.prosoftengineering.com/docs/DataBackupManual.pdf.Depending upon how you configured your backup, restoration can be just as simple as dragging the contents of your backup drive back to your original drive. Otherwise, you can use the easy-to-use File>Restore feature to recover individual files or a complete volume, and if you do incremental backups, you can even restore your data to a specific date. I don't mean to give this feature the short shrift, but you really need to try it for yourself to really appreciate how well it works in your own personal backup/restoration scenario. Again, read the online help file for complete details.As much as I hate doing backups, this program is as powerful as anything out there, and I come from a strong Retrospect ((http://www.emcinsignia.com/products/smb/retroformac/)) background (I used Retrospect for 10 years in my office and never lost a file that was backed up, but if you want to buy a version of Retrospect that will back up to a network drive, or back up to one of the zillions of different types of tape drives still out there, it'll set you back about 500 bucks). Data Backup 3.0 is strong, yet easy enough for me to set it, forget it, and perform my hated backups without having to think about it. I can't imagine giving higher praise. Gee, about the only negatives I could come up with were that the manual posted to the website was the previous version, but the descriptions of types of backups and program fundamentals were mostly the same, so it isn't a huge negative, and Data Backup 3.0 doesn't back up to non-mainstream devices, but if you have specialized needs like that, you are probably already using Retrospect or something like it already.MyMac.com Rating 4.5 out of 5(screen shots and original review at [...] )",software

B000MP0H56,16/17,5.0,"No other program comes close. This program is actually made up of two separate language courses. Thai 1 is based on the Defense Language Institute Thai language course. Thai 2 is a course made by Thai University Professors in Bangkok in 2000. Both courses are great by themselves, but put them together and you get an awesome program that is unbeatable.The games help make studying less of a bore. Though, I must add that the games and puzzles are a little weak (something is better than nothing).Thai Interactive is a very extensive and thorough program. It covers a large range of subjects. Many situations that you might find yourself in will be covered. The vocabulary is useful. Moreover, the vocabulary is used in various dialogs on the program.Plus, the program slowly progresses to more advance learning level to keep the frustration to a minimum. Anyone with a desire to learn Thai will find Thai Interactive very usefully. It doesn't matter if you are an advance student or a complete beginner. Nor does it matter whether you are one of those people who want to learn to read and write Thai or just want to learn to speak Thai without bothering with the written language. Courage Thai Interactive v2 caters to all your Thai learning needs.The only problem is the sound quality. Some of the vocabulary is missing a millisecond of audio; some of the audio sounds like it is being played from a record player. Yet, all audio is intelligible.Many dedicated professionals have worked countless hours on the Courage Thai Interactive v2 to give it the most substantial audio content (roughly 15,000 audio files) of any Thai language program available. Furthermore, the audio is of native Thai people (male, female, young and old). So, you can get accustomed to hearing and understanding a reasonable portion of the Thai society you might meet while in Thailand.But, if you want to try something with better sound quality try ""Spoken Thai"" software. It has a lot of very clear audio files, but unlike Courage, the audio files are all spoken by one Thai woman. Plus, ""Spoken Thai"" software does not have games and puzzles like Courage does. But it does have other very useful features.There are plenty of good software programs out there for learning Thai (ie. ""Spoken Thai,"" ""World Talk,"" ""Thai for Beginners"" etc.)...

A few minutes on the phone with their Tech Support people to supplement the manual and the help feature and I was pointed in the right direction.

So you think to yourself, &quot;well, ok, I have ERwin, so I'll just export it to that...&quot;, but then you find out that Visio can IMPORT an ERwin model, but not export one??? What a strange omission! If Visio could export an ERwin model, I could buy ONE seat of a $4000 forward engineering database tool, and innumerable seats of $400 Visio! Then I could export to ERwin, forward engineer, and have my whole team using a very approachable, inexpensive tool to boot! I don't know, maybe even Microsoft if afraid of the mighty, abusive, litigous Computer Associates! This is kind of like the Dead Sea of software products: It will take you in, but you'll never get out!In the software portion, it also is pretty much a dead end for forward engineering, although very cool and complete for documentation purposes, but Microsoft is also very tight with Rational and doesn't want to upset that apple cart either. One thing I was disappointed about was that nothing showed up as far as Java, C#, or .NET data types. I thought this was a little weird, as that's kind of the reason I upgraded. I didn't install it on my .NET server though, so maybe if you do that it picks that up, but to leave out Java is a little bit of an omission, I think.On the plus side, the interface is beautiful, it does everything but the kitchen sink documentation wise, the shapes and the way they interact is downright magical, and the thing below about the software registration is really overblown: The only thing they make you provide is the country you reside in. In fact, it says right on the CD case &quot;Don't lose this number! You must use it EVERY TIME you install this software.&quot; Microsoft is realistic: they know that you will most likely put it on at least two of your computers, and they're not in panic mode.Bottom line: The best &quot;single source&quot; documentation tool ever devised is Visio 2002.",software

B0002X0514,11/12,3.0,"I do agree with the other review I saw on here that this program has memory issues which is why I can't, at this time, rate it higher. Indeed if you let the GhostSurf surf protection run for several days it will eat up more and more memory. So I don't use the Ghostsurf protection in this manner. I turn it on only when doing research or when I want to check out sites I haven't been to before. For my day to day surfing I want the sites I visit to use cookies and know who I am giving me the content I've asked them for. If you use Ghostsurf only when you want to mask your identity it works great.Also don't forget there are other great tools in this product. The antispyware program found more spyware and potential spying applications than Lavasoft's Ad-Aware or Spybot Search & Destroy. For instance it listed a key logger application those programs didn't mention and an ftp server. It actually lists software that can be used for spying on you versus just website cookies that track your internet activity (which it tracks as well).Also the program comes with an easy to use tool to encrypt your data.I would recommend purchasing this program considering all the tools you get, the price, and that Ghostsurf does work well as long as you don't keep it running for several hours straight.Another perk is that unlike Anonymizer's program this one doesn't need to be renewed yearly.",software

I installed it in Windows 7 ( after installing the Plustek Windows 7drivers ) and it works fine for the B&W; negatives I'm scanning ( nice B&W; balance and great detail at 7200 dpi ). I had read a review of the 7200 that said that Silverfast produced pixelated artifacts in it's scan and that VueScan was a better program, so Idownloaded the VueScan trial program and compared them. At 7200 dpi I saw definite pixalation at white and dark interfaces inVueScan, but none in SilverFast ( see scan and cropped enlargements )which renders the grain of the silver extremely well.At least for B&W; negatives this program couldn't be easier to use, all I have to adjust manually is the scan box size after itpre-scans, the black and white contrast are always very good to excellent, as opposed to VueScan which needed adjusting to getdetail in the shadow areas.

B000BS2V44,1/1,3.0,"This review is ""after"" I used the Garmin with the Chip in Italy.The install was very easy but theIssues:1) After changing the country to Italy selecting a destination to an Italian city was difficult. Entering ""Milan"" or ""Milano"" provided a result of cities in Michigan. After using the ZIP for the location in Milano I was able to change the city location.2) The instructions for turns and streets rarely matched the street signs. The Garmin used street names, with terrible pronunciation, but the street signs would use the number designate and direction to the next major city.3) This issue may be more of an issue with Italian street signs and timing of instructions as they appear before a turn. We missed or selected many wrong turns. At times the exits off the roundabouts were wrong and did not match the signs. Many times the road split into 3. Determination of which branch was not specified and did not become clear until the road went in the wrong direction.4) The display was configured ""Miles/Hour"" and not ""KMs/Hour"". The ""Miles/Hour"" indicator did show the correct maximum limit in Miles/Hour for the sections of road, however the Highway signs rarely displayed the Maximum Limit, just the Minimum based on the lane. Since the Garmin also shows current speed I just used the Garmin to manage speed and rarely used the car's speedometer.5) Directions to Tremezzo (Lake Como) from Malpensa were wrong. The Garmin wanted us to exit on the South Entrance and the North entrance was the correct route. Luckily we had instructions, from the Hotel, and followed those to the correct exit from the highway.6) Directions for a place we stayed in Sienna were not accurate nor the best for time. The location was south of the city but directions wanted to take us from the north end through the city instead of around the city and approach from the south. We used instructions from the B&B; then let the Garmin ""recalculate"".Italian drivers constantly exceed the speed limit so changing lanes is frequent on the highways. They also tend to ride your bumper especially on roads where there is room for only one car. In these circumstances precise instructions and turns that match road signs would be ""very"" nice and not hearing ""recalculating"" would be even nicer.Driving in Italy can be a little stressful and requires constant attention. I would recommend paper instructions from another source, preferable a local person, and then use the Garmin for backup.",software

B0001XNGZ2,1/1,5.0,"I bought Final Draft 7 a few years ago for screen writing purposes. It's a great product. However, it's pricey, and many budding novelists and screenwriters are on limited budgets.I've recently discovered software that is elegant, intuitive, remarkably easy to use while also being incredibly versatile, and it costs about 10 times less than Final Draft. It offers the similar features and more. It's called Scrivener. It's Mac native, but the Windows Beta is being shipped in the spring. Trial versions of both are available at their website ""literatureandlatte(dot)com"".Created mainly with novelists in mind, it includes templates for many other types of writing including thesis styles, recipe books, essays, AND movie and TV screenplays. It may have more features than you need. Google the product name and take it for a test drive. For the cost-conscious, Scrivener might do everything you need it to do. Once you've written your work, the software compiles it and saves it. Again, multiple output formats are available including PDF.Bonus: everything you write in Scrivener is fully exportable in its editable state to many formats, INCLUDING Word and Final Draft 7 and 8! So you can't go wrong. If you try Scrivener and find you want the full-features of Final Draft, you're out less than $50 bucks (there are various discounts for educators, etc) and your work is still usable when you upgrade to Final Draft.Double Bonus: if you participate in and win NaNoWrimo, and can wait until November 2011 to buy, assuming the company continues this practice in 2011, you may be eligible for a very generous discount off the purchase price. (To win NaNoWriMo, participants upload 50,000 words of fiction by the 30th of November to the NaNo website.) I won this year (2010), and with the discount, I got mine for less than $25.",software

B00006OAQU,1/1,4.0,"Now, normally I wouldn't have gotten this game. All the reviews say it's terrifying, and I'm really not into that. But, since I got it as a Christmas present, I gave it a try. And I will be the first to tell you that it's NOT terrifying, and it's actually pretty good! I'm going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.PLOT - 5/5: Nancy goes to visit her friend Sally MacDonald at Moon Lake because Sally says some terrible things have been happening at her lakeside cabin. When Nancy gets there, though, Sally has left out of fear. So Nancy decides to stay and solve the mystery of the ghost dogs who show up at night and attack the cabin. I thought this was a really good plot. Unlike in some other ND titles, I really wanted to solve the mystery and find out where these dogs were coming from. And trust me, the dogs weren't the least bit scary. The plot wasn't too short or too long. Another solid plot from Her Interactive!CHARACTERS - 4/5: There was a real lack of characters in this game. There were only 3 that you could actually see. I guess they did that so Moon Lake would really feel desolate, and it worked. The three main characters were Red Knott, an anti-social bird watcher, Emily Griffen, the store owner who has a fun accent, and Jeff Akers, the lone park ranger. Overall, the characters were OK. I kind of wish there was more, though.SETTING - 4/5: The setting was pretty good. I can't say it was beautiful or anything, because although it was well done, it was just kind of creepy looking. But there was lots to explore, including a whole forest maze that was really hard to get the hang of. There wasn't much to see inside the cabin, or around the lake, but the forest was pretty big so that made up for it.PUZZLES - 4/5: The puzzles were pretty easy in this game. I could figure most of them out without a walkthrough. The maze was probably one of the hardest puzzles, and I kept getting lost. But other than that they were all short and sweet.WAS IT CHALLENGEING?: Nope. I never got frusterated, I only died like once, and I barely used a walkthrough. 2/5ENDING - 5/5: The ending was actually good! I liked how they revealed who the culprit was, and catching them was very clever. Plus everything leading up to the ending was fun too.FINAL SCORE:Plot: 5Characters: 4Setting: 4Puzzles: 4Challenge: 2Ending: 5= 24, divided by 6 = 4 stars",software

B000ALM5Y8,0/0,1.0,"I've used Netscape Composer for 7-8 years before ""upgrading"" to Dreamweaver. I have TWO Dreamweaver manuals. But DW remains SUCH A PAIN to use.* When I change the template, Dreamweaver should ask me if I want to change all pages created with the template. But sometimes it asks, and sometimes it doesn't. Why? (When it doesn't ask, it means the pages created by the template remain unchanged).* When I create a template, Dreamweaver puts it in a Template folder. Then when I create a page with it, the internal links all say /Template/index.html or /Template/books.html or whatever. This means that when I upload pages, it can't find other links on the website.* And if I move the template out of the Template subfolder and try to ""update"" the links of all pages created with it...well, that doesn't work either.* Dreamweaver won't let me create my own pages the way I want. I want to pick my own font, size, etc. for each page. But DW keeps forcing ""styles"" on me. I pick NONE for style. Then when I pick a 14 Font, suddenly DW has picked STYLE 2 (or whatever). So I go back to NONE for style, and now my font is gone.* Or I'll pick a 14 Font Size, then a Lucinda Sans Font, and now the Font Size is changed. So I change the font size back to 14, and now the font is changed to Verdana, or whatever.A nightmarish program, in that it doesn't do what I want it do do. I keep redoing, and redoing everything, because sometimes DW will accept my instructions, and sometimes not. Everything has to be done 1 to 8 or so times before DW works.It's said that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over, and expecting a different result. Well, with DW you can do the SAME thing over, and you DO get a DIFFERENT result. Weird.* Oh yeah, the WYSIWYG feature does NOT work. I previewed a page in Firefox. It looked one way. Then I uploaded the page to my website, and looked at it again in the SAME Firefox -- only now it looks different -- some different fonts, some different colors.Crappy program.",software

It's especially great if you have the hard disk space. Drives are cheap now so there's no excuse. I allocated more than the 10% (the more the better) and I have 3 disks installed with different partitions. GoBack has been awsome when I install a software that is not working properly; or if a spyware hijacked my pc, etc. It's very easy to use (reading the manual is a most). The only problem I've had was using Partition Magic only because I didn't read the manual beforehand. I now know that I have to disable GoBack in order to use Partition Magic. This is not a perfect software. I don't like the uninstall when upgrading OS or installing service packs. Overall if you have important information on your PC and you are constantly doing work, I highly recommend it. For those of you who had trouble with the software I would go back and rethink the purpose you bought this software.

B000PS6QY6,0/0,2.0,"If you are an amateur videographer and are looking for software that is simple and easy to edit movies and add simple effects with, then Pinnacle Studio 11 is fine. However, if you plan on rendering a movie over 5 minutes, then its not. I have used many low-end video editing software titles, but I have never had rendering problems like this. A few minutes into the Render it just hangs. I have applied multiple patches, but have not been successful in this endeavor yet. I was introduced to Pinnacle by a co-worker who uses Avid, the professional version of the software and it worked really well. However, this is really garbage. I have also used Sony Vegas Studio Platinum, Roxio (this was the first tool I ever used, but it is painfully slow and clunky), and I have dabbled in Adobe. After using all of these different titles, I would recommend them over Pinnacle Studio 11 Ultimate at this point until the day comes when Pinnacle releases a patch that can actually allow you to fully render a long movie. After being miserable with this product for a few months now, I have given up and been using Vegas Platnum. My experience is so positive with it, that I just upgraded to the professional edition. Each editing software has some advantages and disadvantages over others, and you will often be in situations where you can justify using two editors for one project, but I can say that it will be a long time before I ever include Pinnacle in one of my projects again. After this review, you may wonder why I gave Pinnacle 2 stars vs 1 star. The reason is that the overall software has the potential to be good, the user interface is fine, its pretty easy to use and learn.

I then found out that the v9 is actually a stand-alone, and not an upgrade version, so I could have saved money by going straight for the supposed ""upgrade.""

They were right, it took about 150 mb RAM on a 512 mb RAM system using Win 2000 Pro..really pretty inefficient! Granted, the real-time antispy has been beefed up quite a bit, but at what a cost..the 2006 version uses less than half that amount of RAM, plus the 2007 version uses about double the hard drive space to boot..!

B00067G66E,3/3,4.0,"If you want to see the future of pen computing, MathJournal is a ""must have"" application for you. If you use math routinely (or even semi-routinely) or if you've ever felt math ""disabled,"" then you owe it to yourself to see what MathJournal could do for you. Combined with the new TabletPC, MathJournal creates the ""intelligent piece of paper"" that we all wished that we had in math class. You literally handwrite an equation or math expression and MathJournal recognizes the problem and provides a menu of solution approaches, including numerical, symbolic or even logical solutions (depending, of course, on the math itself). Amazingly, MathJournal does this without cumbersome format rules or restrictions; the similarities to writing on a pad of paper are truly impressive.Similarly, the range of problem types that MathJournal can tackle is equally impressive. Simple arithmetic, to equations, to SYSTEMS of equations, to integrals and derivatives... including some purely symbolic solutions... xThink has created a tool that is technically impressive, but more importantly is GENUINELY USEFUL in the real world. Both students and working professionals (that's me...!) will find things to like about MathJournal.Of course, like any groundbreaking tool, MathJournal isn't perfect. Math recognition is sometimes a little touchy, but once you have a little experience, this particular problem tends to be minimized. MathJournal has an excellent Help Guide (Users Manual), but you do need to read it, as some features are not entirely intuitive. In particular, pay attention to the ""Style Guide,"" which gives some good tips on how to space the elements of a math expression. Getting used to this early on makes a BIG difference in your percentage of recognition success! The new Animation Tool, which allows you to show how physical systems would actually behave according to their governing math, is frankly hard to work. It needs some improvements.However, xThink's track record in this latter regard has been EXCELLENT to date. It's worth noting that after the initial release (August, 2004), they have issued frequent updates as users have reported problems. Even better, a major upgrade was posted early this year, featuring improved math recognition, the Animation Tool, and numerous smaller improvements.It is clear that xThink is in this for the long haul, and that MathJournal is going to continue to be improved in the foreseeable future. More than anything else, this track record of continous improvement argues that MathJournal is worth SERIOUS consideration if you have any use at all for math in your day-to-day life. Note that while MathJornal works best on a TabletPC, you can also use it on a conventional PC with a peripheral graphics tablet (some of which can be quite inexpensive...!) You need a minimum of Win2k OS and the .NET 1 framework, which can be downloaded from the MIcrosoft website.",software
B0002V87ES,17/21,2.0,"This is not exactly the same bundle, but I suspect the same issues would arise based on the other reviews. I am offering this in the hope that it may save others time and trouble:1) Back your full system up via an image backup program before you begin, just in case. Perform all installs using the true Administrator account, not just an account in that group. Also, the installs may go easier if you turn off anti-spyware programs before beginning the installs. These products make lots of changes to the registry. Spybot, Spysweeper, the MS Anti-Spyware beta, and other programs that monitor registry changes will at best slow things down. Remember to turn the programs back on before going online.2) Uninstall all prior versions of any Symantec products the programs replace or update. This is only supposed to be required for older version (2003 and before). Symantec always has problems with new installs.3) After uninstalling and rebooting without error, install the Firewall first. If you do SystemWorks first, it may complain about the version of Anti-Virus installed when you get to the Firewall. Run live update for Internt Security bofore proceeding. This may have to be run a few times until no new updates are found and everything is installed.4) Install SystemWorks. When it asks about changing the settings on your NIC (it may only do this if it sees a local network and a shared internet connection), CANCEL. I didn't, and was unable to get online for a few days. I had to resore from backup and reinstall to solve the problem. If the intent of the changes the program makes are to block online access, it is effective. It was not welcome, nor was the point of the chnges clearly stated.5) Run Live Update, again and again until no updates are fonund.As I have found for each of the past several versions, the programs appear to work well. Getting them to work and not cause trouble is more trouble than it should be.I called Tech Suport in the hope that the Internet access problem could be easily resolved. I was routed to a pleasnt woman in (I would guess India or Pakistan) who had a terrible time with my accent. Her knowledge of the program was limited to whatever the knowledgebase she was reading said. Her job seemed to be to convince me that it was not Syymantec's fault. I thought her job was to help me resolve the problem. I was wrong. I was not convinced and nothing she suggested I do resolved the problem.",software
B0000E3QN9,2/4,3.0,"Since SuSe 8.0 I have been pretty faithful to the german distro, but this last one irritated me greatly. If you are looking for a good mid-level distro with a fair amount of control and stability and good mid-mix of products that come with it, here you go. It has a little bit of cake no matter what flavor you like to eat. Unfortuneately, being a linux user for some years, it didn't quite stand up to my expectations.For one, a lot of programs I am used to were either slightly out of date or missing. And due to the file structure of SuSe, it takes some long config file changes just to get stuff to install properly. Toss into the mix the fact that a lot of the programs it brags about are only on the profession edition, and you might want to go for the more expensive professional edition or download a free version of another distro instead.It is a good system, but not for me and probably not for others who know what they want unless it just happens to be what SuSe gives them.",software

It's also great because of the role playing game parts, the conversations and the exploring.In most first-person shooters, you just go through the levels, shooting stuff and maybe finding a secret place. In Deus Ex, you can play through the entire game without shooting anyone, you can play the game over five times and still find a huge amount of new stuff, and you can talk to people.The only bad part is the voice acting, which isn't very good.BUY IT RIGHT NOW.",software
B0001GU88M,25/29,5.0,"I've seen some of the reviews on this forum. They range from very bad ones to excellent remarks. The last one from &quot;A Software used from Seattle&quot; is exagerated and obviously he did not take the time to read the manual. When you render a 3D image with the 3DTrueView option, the BMP file with this image is saved in the &quot;Samples&quot; Directory under &quot;Program Files/3D Home Architect/Design Suite Deluxe6/Samples&quot;. Also, if all you want is a snapshot of the 3D image on the screen, you can press the Alt key, hold it and press &quot;Print Screen&quot; on your keyboard, then you simply &quot;Edit-Paste&quot; the image into Word, excel, etc.Now to the review part:RESULTING IMAGEI've used Punch AS3000 extensively, and while the rendering of shadows is much faster than with 3D Home Architect, AS3000 lacks the ray-tracing engine therefore cannot render surfaces that reflect such as mirrors, glossy marble, etc.The resulting images from 3DHA Design Suite are VERY, VERY close to a photograph. The ones from AS3000 tend to look Dull because of the lack of reflective surface support.Also, 3DHA allows for many different views, 2D with textures, 3D from top view, real-time editing in 3D of the location of objects, etc.FLEXIBILITY OF THE TOOLSFirst of all, Punch's software is VERY limited in the configuration of items such as Doors, Windows, Kitchen Cabinets, Fences, Stairs, and all pre-loaded objects in general.3DHA has all the dimensions and features of each object available for change.Punch AS3000 offers a built-in 3D object editor but cannot import popular industry-standard formats such as 3DS files, whereas 3DHA does, giving access to thousands of free objects available on the WEB.Textures are all pre-defined on Punch AS3000, meaning you cannot easily (without messing with file sizes, pixel counts, directories, etc.) add textures. On 3DHA you can add a texture from a BMP file with a few clicks and apply to object on the screen. Also, Objects have their surface groupings defined so you can for example, change the color of the wood of a Sofa without going leg-by-leg.3DHA can also export to DXF AND 3DS, allowing your design to be used / rendered on industrial / professional level software. Punch AS3000 can only export to VRLM in 3D and to DXF on 2D.I sincerily believe 3DHA is a more professional software (actually it is a down-sized version of a professional package from CADSOFT).This is to me the best VALUE for the $99 retail price.Marco.",software

B000ES6L5Q,11/13,1.0,"I've been using PlanPlus 4.11 for about 6-8 months on my Tablet PC running XP Tablet PC SP2. I had some complaints about 4.11 -- it eats CPU, it crashes, I miss some functionality I had with paper (like the ability to write in the margins) -- but 5 lasted about 2 hours before I was uninstalling it and reinstalling 4.11. Why? Well, this one seems to be even slower than 4.11. I can no longer check things off quickly with a pen -- they've created cute little symbols so it now takes longer to check them off. I'm used to thinking with either a pen or keyboard, but this gives me the worst of both -- I can't take advantage of the tablet functionality when I'm locked into selecting a symbol. 4.11 could figure out which symbol I wanted from my handwritten version and substitute it -- 5.0 requires that I select one from the list. SLOW! I also reset my stationary three times -- and I am not a new user of either FC software or software in general -- and it would not keep my preferences. This is the first upgrade I had of any product that was so much worse I went back to the old one. To be honest, if I hadn't already paid for the 4.11 version, I'd probably use GoBinder Lite -- it's free and came with the Tablet. GoBinder from Agilix is the underlying software that supports PlanPlus, so it isn't much different. GoBinder Lite is geared to students, but you can customize most of it to regain PlanPlus functionality. This software is not worth the price -- at any price! I gave it one star only because I could not give it 0.",software

B00008ZL5C,4/4,2.0,"VOYAGE TO A PREHISTORIC PLANET was made in 1965, stars Basil Rathbone, and the cover depicts one snarling and one glaring dinosaur towering over three space-suited astronauts. Does anything more really need be said?Plot - The year is 2020 and American astronauts and Russian cosmonauts are traveling to Venus. I've read somewhere that this is a Russia film that had scenes inserted and some phony American credits plastered on it prior to release, but wasn't interested enough to see if my favorite internet search engine could cough up the answers to that mystery. Rathbone plays a scientist on the satellite Lunar 7 and the other `star' in this one, Faith Domergue, is an astronautlette on the Venus-orbiting Vega. A handful of `nauts and John the Robot are on the Venus surface, dodging the stray alamosaurus and/or 12-foot-tall man-eating venus flytrap while finding evidence of an ancient Venusian civilization.There probably was an okay Russian movie here before Roger Corman Productions got their hands on this one. John the Robot is cool and some of the special effects are a cut above the standard glop they were putting out then. The story drags terribly, though, and Rathbone is apparently included for name recognition rather than to serve the plot or to move things along. Thankfully, they don't dress him up in a goofy costume or otherwise embarrass him. The pacing is terrible, the dubbing is atrocious and there's no drama to speak of.

Don't waste your time trying to get help from the company either.The only other good point about the product is the cables it comes with as it is possible to use them with other software packages like Motorola Phone Tools.,software

Add the new computer and you have $1,075 wasted.And even when it did work, I would have 4 out of 10 writes fail on me. They kept pointing to the recorder.Well, after months of this BS, I did a fresh install from the recovery disk on my new computer and installed another software program.

B0002T88E4,11/11,3.0,"When I reviewed McAfee VirusScan 8.0, I only gave the program a rating of 2-stars. I've increased the rating this time around to 3-stars, but only because in hindsight I think I was too harsh on McAfee regarding what I consider to be blatant advertising, otherwise known as McAfee SecurityCenter.I'll talk more about that in a little bit, but first let's review the actual virus scanning ability.McAfee VirusScan 9.0 is, essentially, the same program as the previous version. The only real difference is the scanning engine that operates the program, which is a behind-the-scenes item. Other than that, the only changes are cosmetic in nature.As with the previous version, VirusScan 9.0 is relatively easy to install. I say relatively easy because before you can install the program, you need to uninstall any previous VirusScan versions as well as follow the ""pre-install"" instructions that come with it. (WARNING: I also recommend that you uninstall ALL McAfee products on your computer before trying to install any VirusScan version. VirusScan is notorious about causing conflicts if you do not perform what they call a ""clean"" install.)Despite following the above advice, I installed, updated, and adjusted the settings in less than 10 minutes. I experienced no problems with the set up, or with conducting several test scans.In version 8.0, McAfee condensed not only the number of settings to adjust, but also the number of levels you had to navigate in order to get to all of the settings. The company also introduced their ""virus map"" feature, which allows you to, if you wish to participate, anonymously send virus information to the map system. The virus map also allows you to track viruses around the world. Wisely, McAfee left these options alone.One area I wish McAfee had made a change to is how the program ""updates"" itself. I prefer to have the program tell me when an update is available to download (I've never really been comfortable in allowing any program to automatically download an update). Unfortunately, this requires me to physically log-in to McAfee's Website each and everytime there is an update. Thankfully, I participate in Microsoft's Passport program, so logging in only requires a click of a button. But I still think you should be able to program your McAfee username and password into Security Center. In addition, the time required to download an update is still substantially more than it was back in version 7.0. Luckily, I now have a DSL connection so the time requirement isn't that bad. But if you still have a dial-up connection, be prepared for what can be substantial update times.In all the years I have used McAfee VirusScan, I have never once had a virus or trojan horse successfully download or install on my computer. I give the virus scanning ability of McAfee a 5-star rating.So why the overall reduced rating? There are three reasons for it.REASON 1: For some reason, McAfee can't help themselves when it comes to screwing up either VirusScan or Security Center during updates. In each of the last four years, McAfee has issued an update that caused severe problems for its users. During version 7.0, it was the introduction of Security Center through an update that caused many computers, mine included, to lose the ability to connect to our ISPs. During version 8.0, a Security Center update created a boot-up problem that caused many computers, again mine included, to frequently be unable to start VirusScan. I'm hoping this will be the year that McAfee can avoid screwing up our computers during the udpates, but I won't hold my breath.REASON 2: McAfee's customer service is one of the worst in any industry. Their live instant messaging help is a joke. The people who run this don't listen to your problem at all. They are only trained to have you run through a series of steps. Last year my then ISP made a change in how users connected to the Internet that caused a conflict with VirusScan. My ISP knew exactly how to fix this, but I needed to get one piece of information from McAfee. Their customer service people refused to listen to me when I tried to explain to them what I needed. When I refused to follow their ""remedy"" instructions, they would disconnect from the conversation. In an effort to get an answer, I finally capitulated and followed their instructions. Big mistake. Their instructions so screwed up my computer that I had to reinstall my operating system, as well as pay money to talk to McAfee on the phone (even then, it took three weeks and 5 different people before I got my answer).REASON 3: I still do not like the blatant advertising that is called Security Center. I know this is not a big deal to many people, but it just really bugs me. The taskbar icon that is installed is not what bothers me (I actually like this feature, because I don't have to add desktop icons for each McAfee program; instead, the Security Center taskbar icon keeps everything in one, easily accessible place). What really bothers me is the Security Center splash screen (which cannot be disabled) that pops up every time you start, or restart, your computer. This splash screen is oh-so-nice in telling you whether or not you have also installed McAfee's Firewall Plus, Privacy Service, and SpamKiller. Having to see this everytime I start my computer makes me feel like I paid good money to install a pop-up advertisement.Let me condense all of the above into the following: The underlying scanning engine is about the only real change in McAfee VirusScan 9.0 (although, this version does appear to fix a couple of bugs that were introduced through the previous version's updates). The Virus Map is still neat, the update feature is still time consuming, and Security Center is still basically a McAfee adversting tool.Bottom line: If the updates during version 8.0 are causing you problems, then go ahead and buy this version. Otherwise, it won't hurt to wait for version 10 before you upgrade.",software

I find myself turning to the (very poorly organized) Help for answers to basic issues.2. The Help is terribly organized. For example, I needed information about adding folders to my collections. Searching on ""folders"", ""adding"", ""import"", ""organize"", provided no usefull information.3. The Organizer is supposed to automatically add images that I place in its ""watched folders"". It does not, and the Help is no help.4. The worst problem is moving files with the Windows Explorer instead of the built-in Organizer. It loses track of the files and will ask you to locate them manually one by one (all 1000 files I moved). Trying to move the files within Organizer is a major pain. Completely non-intuitive. You are supposed to be able to drag-and-drop, but the Help says that an alt-drag is required. Niether worked for me.5. Basic commands are hidden in unexpected places.

Prepare for a major time waste learning to use a program that is supposed to make your work more efficient.To summarize - this may be a great program, but the interface and controls make it too frustrating to use.

In order to check it I had to go to the state tax website and print out a copy of the forms and instructions. This makes it much more likely (as in my case) that you will file the forms seperately. Intuit should post a warning about this on the E-file page. The fact that they don't makes it clear that they are cynically trying to squeeze you for every dime.

The pdf feature and the high resolution preview of eps files and OSX compatibility as well as it's familiarity made me give it a try. I've been using Xpress 6 for about a month now and I'm not impressed. Customer support is weak at best and it is almost impossible to register because users have to enter a serial number and a registration number and a one hundred digit activation code (I'm not kidding 100 numbers and letters). Quark claims it's software will activate automatically on-line. It doesn't if you have a firewall. Many of the new features Quark claims to have added are extensions that must be installed separately (high res preview for eps images being one of them). Quark 4.11 users will be upset to learn that 6.0 will only save down to version 5.0 and there isn't a plug-in to fix this oversight as Quark claims.

B00009J5TZ,23/26,5.0,"The first time I started using WebShop I was amazed at the possibilities. I've been using WebShop by Boomerang Software for over 2 years, and have had nothing but excellent results. Jut upgraded to WebShop Platinum, which features ""rollback"" to go to previous-saved versions of a project and the beneficial HTML code view so that I can see what's going on in the background.With one program, I designed my Web store, published it to the Web host of my choice (in this case with Boomerang's Web hosting services), sign up for an account with a third-party merchant provider (Authorize.net or SecurePay) and start selling!The interface is organized well and is easy to use. There are too many menus, which can be confusing at first, but I got used to them after a while. Best of all, any problems that I had were promptly and thoroughly answered by Boomerang's free email tech support -- a rare find these days.WebShop is an amazing program -- I highly recommend it!!!",software

B0002Z44YG,0/0,2.0,"Punch is not really useful for anything than a very rough mock-up of a home, and even then it is buggy and slow. For example, it is possible to crash the software and get your model into a state where you can't edit it by putting in small wall segments on the outer edge of the house (while outlining the basic shape). It has a very slow refresh when any amount of design information is entered, so that it takes forever to redraw the screen (this is on a quad core i9). The floor height settings are broken, if you put in a certain height, add a few walls, and then change the height, you are out of luck - time to start over from scratch.Overall, this is little more than somebody's buggy pet project. Don't touch it with a ten foot framing beam.",software
B00006I50O,13/13,1.0,"I bought this version because I thought it would have an updated graphics engine and also you got 3D Home Landscape Designer v4.0 with it. Well neither is true. The other reviewers have already covered why the interface sucks so I will give you a different reason. The Landscape Designer that comes with Professional 5.0 is a ""Special Edition"". When I got it I thought: Oh, a special edition it must have more plants and objects with it. False! Here is what the readme file says after you buy the overpriced version:3D Home Landscape Designer SE 4.0 is a Special Edition version of 3D Home Landscape Designer 4.0. 3D Home Landscape Designer 4.0 contains the following additional features and content:Features:* Slope and Elevation Modeling* Plant Editor (ability to create and add new plants, edit plant definitions, and download new plants)* Encyclopedia of Plant Diseases and Cures* Collection of 9500 plant photos in thumbnail and picture mode* Plant Origin (click on a world map to learn your selected plant's region of origin)* Print 3D Views* Align Objects* Group ObjectsContent:* 5500 additional plants* 230 additional 3D Garden Objects* 250 additional Plant Objects* 15 additional Sample PlansHere is the best part: After buying thinking I was getting the two 3D Home products in one package with some special features included, I found out that to get these additional features for Landscape Designer I would have to ""upgrade"" and give Broderbund another *. I think that it should have said this somewhere on the box, and then I wouldn't have bought the combo and be disappointed twice! *as per review policyI didn't buy it through Amazon, and I wish that I would have visited this site before I wasted my money (THIS IS WHY YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO RETURN SOFTWARE). So heed this advice and buy v.4.0. I bought Broderbund's 3D Home v.4.0 instead of Punch's and Sierra's based on others reviews and I would still recommend it over the other ones that are out there currently.I think Broderbund made a big mistake in going in the direction they are. I just hope that they or someone else will bring back an updated cheap version of Art's ""Chief Architect"" to the market, or I win the lottery so I could afford to buy the real deal. I hope Broderbund will honor it's ""100% Satisfaction Guaranteed"" policy as there will probably be a lot of disappointed people who buy this version based on the reputation the previous ones gave 3D Home as I did.",software

B00005NGS5,2/3,5.0,"Really folks, this game has tons of potential, but hardly anyone has ever heard of it. My friend got it as a birthday present, and I played it, and loved it. So I bought it. The races seem to have been ripped off from starcraft however. You can play as the Humans, the Mantis (zerg) or the Celaeron (protoss). However the campaign and gameplay is completely unique. Instead of just building on one planet, you build platforms orbiting planets. Each map consists of a certain number of systems, connected by wormholes. It's a very unique concept, and it's implemented perfectly. The only thing missing from this excellent game is a map editor. This certainly detracts from replayability, but there is a good random map gameplay (similar to age of empires/kings) and there is multiplayer support. But hey, at $..., this is a bargain!

Hit the wireless router just fine, and logged into our home-office network just fine. But Vista refused to then see the network, so no file sharing or printer sharing. Hours were required to hunt down the cause and resolve it.3. Boot and shutdown speeds. Vista took a 60 second XP boot and doubled it. Ditto for shutting down.4. Install size.

B000MP0H56,16/17,5.0,"No other program comes close. This program is actually made up of two separate language courses. Thai 1 is based on the Defense Language Institute Thai language course. Thai 2 is a course made by Thai University Professors in Bangkok in 2000. Both courses are great by themselves, but put them together and you get an awesome program that is unbeatable.The games help make studying less of a bore. Though, I must add that the games and puzzles are a little weak (something is better than nothing).Thai Interactive is a very extensive and thorough program. It covers a large range of subjects. Many situations that you might find yourself in will be covered. The vocabulary is useful. Moreover, the vocabulary is used in various dialogs on the program.Plus, the program slowly progresses to more advance learning level to keep the frustration to a minimum. Anyone with a desire to learn Thai will find Thai Interactive very usefully. It doesn't matter if you are an advance student or a complete beginner. Nor does it matter whether you are one of those people who want to learn to read and write Thai or just want to learn to speak Thai without bothering with the written language. Courage Thai Interactive v2 caters to all your Thai learning needs.The only problem is the sound quality. Some of the vocabulary is missing a millisecond of audio; some of the audio sounds like it is being played from a record player. Yet, all audio is intelligible.Many dedicated professionals have worked countless hours on the Courage Thai Interactive v2 to give it the most substantial audio content (roughly 15,000 audio files) of any Thai language program available. Furthermore, the audio is of native Thai people (male, female, young and old). So, you can get accustomed to hearing and understanding a reasonable portion of the Thai society you might meet while in Thailand.But, if you want to try something with better sound quality try ""Spoken Thai"" software. It has a lot of very clear audio files, but unlike Courage, the audio files are all spoken by one Thai woman. Plus, ""Spoken Thai"" software does not have games and puzzles like Courage does. But it does have other very useful features.There are plenty of good software programs out there for learning Thai (ie. ""Spoken Thai,"" ""World Talk,"" ""Thai for Beginners"" etc.)... But Courage Thai Interactive v2 is the best.",software
B00005JJEU,6/6,3.0,"We just got back from Disneyworld so my daughter was very eager to play this new &quot;game.&quot;She is still playing it, but keeps asking: &quot;where's Mickey?&quot; The idea is that Mickey travels around trying to retrieve stuff missing from the castle. Each missing item can only be recovered after completing a lengthy phonics drill. During most of the drills Mickey and the recognizable Disney characters are off-screen. And you have to correctly answer a large number of questions before you get a prize. The cute animated graphics only briefly disguise the fact that these are pretty routine exercises.The software worked very well on our old PC (AMD 500 Mhz, no graphics card). No problems installing or delays in loading etc...The software automatically adjusts the difficulty level based on the accuracy of the responses. This should allow the software to be used for a long time as a child's skills improve.The software comes with a microphone and voice recognition software. Unfortunately you have to &quot;train&quot; the voice recognition software to understand a user's speech patterns by reading lengthy texts into the microphone. Do you see the problem here? If my daughter could read those texts then we wouldn't be buying this CD... I can read the texts, but my voice is quite different from my daughters.

This allows me to share certain files without having to dump them into my public folder, or provided access to my entire computer,Overall, what sold me on the OS was the fact that, despite these graphical improvements, the system itself is faster. Because its so speedy, I now use spotlight as both a file finder and an application launcher.

B000RAASFK,11/12,4.0,"Overall a good product. It adds fantastic capability to my new Vista HCx for hiking, backpacking, and mountain biking. The ability to correlate location to a topo map quickly via the topo info on the GPS screen is really nice. Getting profile information from your trails is great too for those of us that are data geeks. This mapset makes the GPS far more usable in the backcountry.The one negative I have for Topo 2008 is the lack of trails on it. It is missing major trails that I'm amazed Garmin could have missed. The Colorado Trail and the Continental Divide Trail are the major trails through Colorado, yet Garmin missed these and most other common trails. It has a few trails, but not what I'd expect from this software. That was very dissappointing.All visual content in these maps is simply a static visual representation. None of it is an active element so you can't just tell the PC software or GPS to follow a trail. If you want a trail routing, you need to trace a track over it on the PC and download that as a Track or Route.",software
1843520486,15/16,3.0,"The good part about this software is that it provides a fun and engaging way to learn some basic Cantonese vocabulary. The words and phrases are spoken twice, in a male and female voice with accompanying pictures. The games and self tests are fun to work through. It also provides a way to record your voice and compare it to the speakers' pronunciation.The bad part is that it does not go very far in how much content it provides. If you are a serious student this will not provide you with any grammar, no section on enunciation of particular sounds (a necessity for those of us starting from only romance languages which do not have these sounds), and no explanation how to read the Romanized spelling of words. Also, it gears some of the vocabulary towards tourists but then much of the dialogue is a very formal type that is not even spoken in practice. If the content is geared toward the casual learner then one would suppose they would teach the language as it is actually spoken. My tutor/girlfriend taught me which parts of this program I should ignore.Do not buy this expecting it to go very far in teaching you Cantonese. It is only useful as a supplement to another introductory curriculum that might be lacking in good teaching tools.",software

B00002S9FV,3/3,5.0,"This is our family's second 'Explorer' package. Our first was the Spanish language Explorer, which contained around 22 lessons. Those lessons were plenty to get my 12-year-old launched in learning Spanish, and we were so satisfied that we recently bought the Levels 1 and 2 homeschool edition of the full version.Now I'm studying Indonesian using the Explorer, and considering buying the full version of it when I exhaust the 20-something lessons included in the Explorer.All of the Rosetta Stone products are arranged the same way (as far as I know). Beginning with basic words and phrases, you listen to a native speaker and/or read a phrase and then click on the picture that matches the words you've heard/read. Beginning from that basic approach, all sorts of permutations are possible with this extremely well-designed package: you can toggle in a delay so you have to use your auditory memory; you can practice arranging the words in a sentence in the correct order; you can even practice your pronunciation using a microphone headset (included free when I bought the package, although that was a promotional offer -- you may need to purchase separately). Unlike many language-learning approaches, with Rosetta Stone you learn to read AND speak the language simultaneously. Multiple learners can use the same program, and their progress can be tracked separately.It is helpful to have a dictionary for the target language nearby when you are using Rosetta Stone to check if your inferences about the meaning of words are correct.This program is NOT a phrase-book approach to learning the language. You won't learn how to ask for your restaurant bill or the nearest bathroom, or how to give directions to a taxi driver in the first lesson. Such learning materials are available, of course. The Explorer version also does not have any written grammar instruction; you pick up the grammar intuitively through using the program. The full Homeschool edition comes with booklets, one of which has some guidance on points of grammar.I find that to make the most progress in learning a language, I need to use a phrase/common vocabulary list as a source for flash-cards. I also translate material from the target language to English to get a sense of the way the language works. Of course, a grammar book is also helpful.But none of those print materials can do what Rosetta Stone does so well. I find that the patient repetition Rosetta Stone provides 'sticks in my head' far better than work with any print resource. I wouldn't want to learn any language without Rosetta Stone!",software

B000GHIV2Q,3/3,5.0,"For those of us who need to run Windows applications that don't have a Mac equivalent, I consider this product to be first rate. I am a longtime Virtual PC for Mac user (back from when it was a Connectix product before Microsoft bought it) and the people at Parallels have made me feel very much at home with this product. I think almost every feature from VPC is replicated in Parallels (along with a lot of new ones of their own) which makes it very user friendly if you have VPC experience.The first thing that you notice is the incredible speed at which Parallels Desktop for Mac runs Windows. Having been used to VPC for so long, the speed at which it runs is absolutely incredible, and I had VPC fine tuned for speed pretty well. I am running XP Professional on my iMac (24"", 2.33GHz, 750GB HD, 3GB RAM) which I admit is tricked out, but it runs XP WAY faster than it runs on a dedicated PC that I have at the office (900MHz, 60GB HD, 512MB RAM). Not a fair comparison, I admit, but for anyone like myself who is reading reports of ""near native speed"" and isn't quite sure what that means, I hope that this comparison helps.Before I bought my Intel iMac, I kept going to Apple Stores hoping that they would have a demo machine with Parallels Desktop for Mac installed on it (since they sell it in their stores anyway), but no such luck. I made the leap and I am thrilled that I did!I do not do any gaming, so I have no comments on that, but for running professional applications, you won't even know that you're not working on a dedicated PC. I haven't done the Boot Camp thing because, for me, rebooting is out of the question. There is no need nor desire for rebooting when I can have both systems running simultaneously.As for the people who complain about installation problems, there is no doubt in my mind that they aren't installing it correctly. With a proper installation (which is VERY easy, by the way), everything works flawlessly. Just be certain to install Parallels Tools, which I think a lot of people are forgetting to do.If you need to run Windows applications on your Mac, you will not be disappointed.",software

And as further punishment, I see that the latest price is under $9.00!I have personally confirmed each of the weaknesses mention in the other reviews, plus some:- The editing of walls is cumbersome, as once two walls are connected, you cannot lengthen one without dragging the other along. The Wall Break tool is pointless, since the two halves are still connected.- The dimensioning is lousy. Dragging to a desired length and then releasing the mouse button does not yield the choosen length, and requires many retries to acheive the desired measurement.- It has no provisions for modeling porches.- It doesn't do garage doors.- It does not provide for pocket doors.- There is too much emphasis on frivilous details, such as lighting.- Roofs are not connected to walls...they are just separate objects that float above walls, with large visible gaps and no provision for adjusting their height.- The zoom mechanism is imprecise.- The 3D views are controlled only by the mouse, making for erratic movements and much wasted time in seeking the desired position.- and so forth...I am seeking a refund from the publisher. As mention by another, this is really a prime candidate for a class-action lawsuit. There is no connection between this program and the ones bearing the same name in pass iterations. If it were a decent program in its own right with backward compatability, I wouldn't mind some of the changes.

B0000524QH,2/5,1.0,"Having read the editorial review I realized this is it, I want to buy this Linux for Windows thing to give Linux a try and still have my windows up and running. It turned out to be a mistake.1st of all, I faced a very nasty problem. The computer hangs for no reason during OS loading, after the &quot;calibrating delay loop&quot; message followed by some information about memory and hash tables. I had no idea what can be wrong and spent a day trying different settings in the BIOS, trying to reinstall the system from GUI and text interface and nothing came out of this. A bit later I realized that the problem may have to do with the way memory is used in my computer. My computer is a cheap eMachines eTower 566i2 with Celeron CPU and video is a so-called &quot;intel 3D AGP&quot; thing which is inside a memory controller on the motherboard of the computer and it uses the same base RAM for video unlike a usual video card. Of currently installed 160MBs, last MB is always allocated by that chip for video. So I thought I might try to specify Linux less amount of memory than it thinks. It thinks 160, I tried to install the damn thing in text interface and supplied ther a parameter &quot;mem=128M&quot; and it worked. The kernel no longer hangs up the computer during loading. I bet this is the 1st problem to face for all users of cheap computers based on intel 810 chipset (e.g. that intel 3D AGP thing).But that is not the end of the story... After that I immediately founf yet another problem. 2nd problem... The kernel reports 3 error messages and stops. The mesasges appear altogether as follows: ----8k---- request module [block-major-7]: Root fs is not mounted VFS: can not open root device 07:07 kernel panic VFS: unable to mount root fs on 07:07 ----8k---- I reread the manual a few extra times to see that I'm not following it somewhere and this causes the problem. But the truth is that I do follow the manual (though it looks like the manual describes a normal version of Linux installer DrakX but the actual one which I've got on the CD is different, it's oversimplified for completely stupid people that can not follow the clear manual, the installer prohibits manual manual selection of many settings and leaves the user only a few ones: language, type of mouse, time zone, type of monitor; e.g. more than half of the manual that ships with this product is useless too). The FAQ which can be found on the CD mentions this problem (see in the directory lnx4win of the CD) and states &quot;In most case this problem can be fixed by disabling 'PnP OS support' in your BIOS.&quot; Neither disabling nor enabling of PnP support in my BIOS worked (I reinstalled Linux after making modifications in BIOS settings each time to make sure I don't have different settings in BIOS during installation and loading of installed system). Then the manual explains how the Linux file system, contained in a file on Windows file system, gets set up and if something is wrong with installation and the Linux file system can't be set up these messages appear. Well explained, I now understand how this should normally be done. ...though there's no mention of what to do next if this problem can't be cured by altering BIOS settings. So basically, I can't install Linux for Windows as easily as promoted on the retail box &quot;Linux for Windows allows you to safely and easily run Linux on your Windows computer in 3 easy steps: insert CD, follow step-by-step installation process, reboot the machine&quot;. It just doesn't work that way.Next problem... I registered the product and contacted Linux Mandrake support team. You must know what kind of answers I get... I was recommended to stop the installation of Linux just during the video system setup by resetting the computer and then see what the result is. I have no idea how video system can cause problems with Linux file system, but this is a nice recommendation. Isn't it. OK, now it's 4th day of struggling and I got a very funny response from the support team, namely &quot;Lnx4win wasn't designed for Windows ME. Thus, there is no possibility to use a Windows ME partition to store your Linux files. You definitely need to use linux-dedicated partitions. For this, ...&quot; If you read carefully description of the product, FAQ, readme's throuout CD and the retail box labels, you couldn't miss several places in which it's clearly stated that Linux for Windows *IS* compatible with windows 95, windows 98 and windows ME! Now, this is a support I've dreamed about!Conclusion... If you're new to Linux, don't try this product. Better buy something else and ask your friend who knows very well how to install linux or ask in your computer store to install Linux for some fee or whatever but don't get fooled by Linux for Windows, it won't work even if you follow the manual.",software

B000AQD6GO,6/13,1.0,I was sorry I opened the box. I just tried to edit a Sony DVD video and 8.0 was a joke. For the Menue Styles it only gives you three choices. You can click on a more choices button and it bumps you online to Roxio where you can buy more Menue Styles. Roxio 7.0 had many video Menue Styles to choose from. You think they would add more not less with the 8.0 upgrade. I wanted to delete a scene in the video and it was impossible to find the right menue to do that. I have a new Dell Demension with 1 gig of memory and fastest hard drive and processor available and 8.0 still hung up and seemed sluggish for video editing. If you have Roxio 7.0 stay with that or I am going to try a Sony video editing product. I just ate $80.,software

Adobe Photoshop 7 features vast improvements over Photoshop 6 (my past favorite). In Adobe Photoshop 7, users will be able to catalog their photos for easy retrieval. Their are also several really cool new brushes, including the &quot;healing brush.&quot; This brush is amazing. You can take a picture that has cuts and scratches, and with a few clicks of the mouse have the photo &quot;healed&quot; in no time. Imagine the benefits your photos will receive.The interface has also been made much nicer. I am a novice at Adobe's software, but definitely have had my share of frustrations with previous versions. Not so in Photoshop 7. I am able to easily navigate around the interface to find the tools that I need, when I need them.All of these new features have unfortunately caused a memory crunch. Photoshop 7 runs a bit slower than its predecessor did, but is well worth all of the extra processing power. After using Photoshop 7 for a week, I was twice as productive as I had been with Photoshop 6 after several months!Photoshop 7 is the industry standard in graphic design, and I would highly recommend anyone that can afford it, to purchase a copy of Photoshop 7.

B000059PD8,61/66,1.0,"I was looking for a product that would help me get some ideas for a new cabin project down on paper. I wanted something that would help me with maintaining scale, automate some of the mundane drawing activites, and perhaps inspire me with ideas. I really didn't want or need all the features of the more expensively priced offerings out there. Given the price of this product my expectations were fairly low regardless what the packaging promised. After experimenting with Instant Architect for a few days it failed to meet even the lowest of my expectations. Here are the list of problems as I perceive them. The product looks like a beefed up version of Microsoft paint and it is slow, slow, slow (running on a P3 600 with 392MB RAM). The rendering is buggy especially when scrolling, often hanging, splitting the image or failing to render it completely. The interface is very rudamentary and clunky. Using the &quot;image gallery&quot; is especially unpleasant. The image library leaves much to be desired. Nearly all of the &quot;150 free pre-drawn floorplans&quot; are absolutley pathetic. Don't go looking for inspiration or ideas there! All in all I really think that this application is a comlete waste of money and time.

You can virtually do anything, assuming you have enough money to do what you want. Making complicated trade treaties can make you money fast assuming you have resources to spare. An example would be buying meat from England and selling to Japan. There would be no profit, but you are collecting taxes once they move. You can use covert operations to incite revolts or even assasinate leaders of another nation. If you have the technology, you can launch ICBM's against anybody you choose. This appears to be a great stategy game.There also appear to be a great amount of sad parts to this game. When the game starts it tells us that graphics was not an emphasis in creating the game. So, we have poor graphics. Combat is simply a bunch of dots moving around to kill the enemy. This is also the buggiest game I have ever played. While playing, the game just closes out for no reason.

B000LUYC1M,3/3,1.0,"I had MyDVD 5.5 that came with my Dell and decided to upgrade to MyDVD 9 when I got my new Flip camcorder. I wanted to take the Flip camcorder files (AVI, video: 3ivx MPEG-4 5.0.1, audio: MS ADPCM) and burn them to a DVD. The files seemed to work in MyDVD 5.5 but 5.5 was very slow and didn't have much in the way of menu templates, etc. Clicking the upgrade button on 5.5 took me to the website for 9. MyDVD 9's website seemed to promise a lot more features for a small fee to upgrade. I looked at the website for Easy Media Creator 10 too but was unsure if MyDVD was part of the that package.So, I got MyDVD 9. After the install, I could no longer view the Flip video files using MyDVD 9. I downloaded gspot which confirmed I had the right codecs installed and I was able to view the files in the default Windows viewer and WinAMP. With MyDVD I always got the (/) icon and was never able to select it. I had some Motion JPEG videos with WAV audio in an AVI container that I was able to make a DVD with but it was slower than slow. Even slower than 5.5. Making DVDs was supposed to be fun and this I hated.After some searching on the Roxio forums I discovered: 1) There's a MyDVD 10 and it's part of Easy Media Creator 10 and 2) Other folks could not read MPEG-4 video in MyDVD 9 but could in Easy Media Creator 10. Upgrading to EMC-10 instead confirmed all this. I just received my refund for MyDVD 9. For me, the MyDVD as part of Easy Media Creator 10 worked when MyDVD 9 did not. The MyDVD in EMC-10 is also blazing fast in comparison and so far so good I've had success producing two DVDs.Skip this and get Easy Media Creator 10 instead. Exercise the 30-day refund policy if needed.Customer support for getting my refund was very good. Use the click-to-chat feature on the Roxio website (every web store should have one). I didn't have much luck with email though I think it was their on-line store support I was emailing which is outsourced to Digital River. There also seems to be a lot of good information in the Roxio forums. If you can't find it in the documentation someone on the forums might know.

You don't really need my thoughts here since it is well documented, but I will spend the time because it seems a more valuable use than troubleshooting Intuit's software for them.I have been using, building, reparing, teaching PC's since early 1982 and using Intuit products since their inception. Around the turn of the century, I had two companies and an individual tax return to manage and file.I had Quickbooks, TurboTax and Quicken developed and integrated to help me perform this function in under an hour for each return. Load TTax, import last year's return, download from QB or Quicken, put in a couple of numbers and answer a few questions and you were done. Magnificent! But not anymore.In the first of a one/two knockout punch, Intuit introduced the cDilla disaster with Turbo Tax. So, with considerable effort, I switched tax programs two years ago. No data transfer, no importing, starting from scratch ... a giant leap backwards for computer users. Well, from all of the fallout, did Intuit learn anything, of course not.

B00005O1GE,46/49,3.0,"Office is far and away the best thing Microsoft does, and probably the main reason for their dominance in the software industry. The Mac OS X version of Office is generally regarded as superior to the Windows version, so this is the very best version of all. Having used a trial version for a month, I have to admit that it is in many respects very impressive. Although it occassionally misbehaves, for the most part it works splendidly with the OS X operating system. The interface is very nice: it looks better even than Apple's office suite, Appleworks. It does sometimes hog a little more CPU when it's open but not being used, but that's typical of 3rd party carbon ports.Despite the many fine qualities of his app, I cannot give it a complete endorsement. I suspect that many people buy MS Office because of its prestige and its dominance in the market, not because they necessarily need it. If you rarely use spreadsheet, don't really need to make presentations, and don't need all the extra features of MS Word, then you don't need this application. Excel and Powerpoint are industry standards. If you're in business and you need such things, those are the ones to have. If you're not, you don't really need them. The spreadsheet and presentation program that comes with Appleworks will do fine. (Or if you don't have Appleworks, install XDarwin and use gnumeric or KOffice for free.) As for MS Word, well, to tell the truth, I prefer the Appleworks: it's simply easier to use. In all the times I've used Appleworks, I've never had to go to the help browser to figure out how to accomplish something. With MS Word, even a simple task such as changing or realligning paragraphs requires a visit to the annoying little help box. While I recognize the awesome power of the program, I just don't need anything quite that sophisticated. I suspect that there are a number of people out there who shell out the big bucks for MS Word or Office but who don't really need its power. There's no reason for that. Nor is there any reason to buy it just so you can open us MS Word documents. Appleworks, Abiword, and OpenOffice will open all but the most sophisticated word docs. As for those they can't open, well, let's face it: Mac and Linux users really need to begin putting pressure on people to send documents in file types that use open standards, like rtf and PDF. There's no reason why non-Windows users should cooperate in extending Microsoft's dominance in the market.",software

When I purchased Vista Ultimate on it's actual Release day in January, I purchased the Vista Family pack as to get the two additional Upgrade licenses of Vista Home Premium and I was able to install Vista, both editions, onto 3 completely different PCs with virtually no problem issues at all; no driver compatibility issues, no major performance issues (2 of the PCs that got Home Premium are about 3-4 years old, so of course they are going to run a bit slower than my main PC with Vista, a P4, 3.4Ghz).I am using a Linksys WRT55AG Wireless Router (Absolutely NO Issues at all)that was discovered right away and I have yet to have ANY issues with it. I also have an NVidia GPU and other than not having the ability for Desktop Spanning, all is well on that front as well. Even both of my WD External Drives Drivers were installed with no problems. My Printer was also installed right away without any issues. I have an HP PSC750, and it's about 7 years old.Like I said in the Title, I just don't get it. So many people want to find ANY reason to hate Microsoft... Well, why did you buy this in the first place if you were just going to bash it? Why not just stick with all of the cracked copies out there and save your money?I purchased Vista because I believe it to be a far superior product over XP. Yeah it's flashy and looks like another very famous OS, but it's not that OS. It's not XP. It's new and better and over time, people will see that it's not just another Windows Me.",software

Yes, Windows XP has some security issues, the software is bloated, and it isn't without it's problems, but it is very stable and easy to use (compared to previous versions). Is Linux better? Yes and No. For the average home user, Linux is not a wise choice. I love Linux, but would I recommend my Mom use it? No. she'd be lost. That said I think that if you apply ALL security patches, install a good anti-virus and use the built in firewall (at the very least) you'll be reasonably safe. If you are installing over a current operating system, do yourself a favor and backup your data, wipe off your hard drive and do a clean install of Windows XP. You'll avoid more problems that way. Aside from Server 2003, this is the best Microsoft OS yet. Maybe that isn't saying a whole lot, but considering the alternatives this the OS to get for the average PC user.",software

B000HCVR3K,3/3,2.0,"Don't buy Microsoft Vista unless you have too. It is not an upgrade. I had compatibility problems early on, though most are finally sorted.Office 2007 works well enough and includes some nice features, but none that are worth the upgrade price. And, in an attempt to give the user more creative options, e.g., various formats for page numbers in Word, it is now unnecessarily difficult (and sometimes impossible) to perform tasks that were easy before, e.g., insert a page number in a manner that is not pre-formatted by Word. There are similar difficulties with style formatting, bullets and numbering, cover pages, tables of contents, works cited pages, et cetera.I have not used PowerPoint as extensively, but it appears to work well. The more creative themes make it easier to glam up a presentation.I also have not used Excel as extensively, but have not had any difficulties in my limited use.The biggest problem with 2007 is compatibility with older version due to the change of format from .doc to .docx, et cetera. There are similar changes for Excel and PowerPoint. It is now very difficult for someone running Office 2003 to view/edit Office 2007 documents. This will be a significant issue for individuals who share documents or are required to submit them to users of older version (e.g, e-mailing an assignment to a professor). They will most likely have to save the files in the older version before sharing, which eliminates many of the features and benefits of upgrading.Overall, avoid ""upgrading"" until absolutely necessary.",software
B0000AVF6Z,16/18,3.0,"My kids and I have been using this software for over a month. I have it connected to a MIDI piano.This software allows up to five students to keep track of their progress. One can choose any lesson to start and may switch among different lessons. The software remembers prior progress and picks up where one left off.For each exercise, points are awarded for correct responses and deducted for incorrect responses. The exercises become harder with higher scores and easier again as the score drops down because of wrong answers. This progressive instruction is very nice.I found the accompanying book to be very helpful, as I had no prior theory training.However, the software has limitations:The biggest problem is that it requires the user to strictly follow the lesson format. You only get one shot at playing intervals, for example. I like to learn by repeating the item several times before advancing to the next, to reinforce the sound and the relationship with the name. Trying to repeat the last item results in a wrong answer on the next item.This strict approach also limits exploration and frustrates kids. My kids, ages 10 and 8, don't really like the program and rarely spontaneously use it. My kids really like to learn other stuff on the computer. I would recommend this for kids over the age of 14.Finally, the lack of keyboard or even MIDI-mediated commands neccessitate constantly moving one's hands from the MIDI keyboard to the mouse, moving the pointer to the right icon and clicking. The mouse should not be necessary to work this program that keyboard oriented.I did contact tech support for one problem. I sent an email on Sunday afternoon and got a response about an hour later!

Moreover, with all the planning constraints imposed on the construction area, distance from boundary, etc I think HAD 4.0 is essential.- I'm English and my architect is French. We need a common tongue. I have already sent him one set of ""plans"" and his attitude ""for once I know exactly what is required of me"", I certainly haven't compromised his ""artistic integrity"" and I had the distinct impression he was interested in acquiring a copy of HAD 4.0 for himself.- For the most part I found HAD 4.0 to be a stable programme in both W2000 and WXP. There seems to be a glitch when ""File-Save"" is activated for the first time and the programme hangs. The best way to overcome this is to close down the File window and wait for the prompt for you to save the file. Incedentally, HAD 4.0 has an excellent autosave option perhaps anticipating this problem where all ""corrupted"" files are re-presented.What would I change. The price is excellent and I would certainly pay 2-3x the current price. The roofing option is limited but for 90% of designs is not a deathknell.

B000056NST,4/5,4.0,"It is true that Premiere does have some problems in crashing and other bugs that need to be fixed. But overall is is a very powerful and helpful program for video editing. And about the comments ""don't get it if you're a beginner"", it's all [bad]. Adobe has a very friendly interface. Of course you can't expect to have never used a video-editing software tool and become an expert as soon as you open it. You have to play around with it a little.Concerning the program, Premiere has exelent exporting encoders. There is virtually no decrease in quality if you do it right. Also there are numerous edit facilities in transactions, video and audio effects. And remember that there are many plug-ins for this video-editing software, so you can always buy more and expand your Premiere.About the system requirements, you have to ask yourself just how much of a profesional are you. Yes you can use a Pentium II with the minimum of 128 MB RAM, but then you're talking about editing small things. Having tested it on a Penium III 800MHz / 256 SDRAM and an Athlon 900MHz / 256 SDRAM, I have come to realise that this is satisfactory for small edits such as home videos and video clips. But if the concern is about low-budget movies, you either need a very powerful computer system, or a video-editing card...Also when editing video, it is usually edited in DV format for minimum quality loss. This means large amounts of HD storage.The upgrade 6.0 offers web facilities and better fire-wire capturing, which brings the program one step above what it was, as capturing in particular is perhaps the most important aspect in video editing.Wraping it up, I would recomend Adobe Premiere to any beginner who wants to become serious, as well as to the profesional who has a relatively low budget.",software

B0000CEM5O,1/1,4.0,"This is beyond a doubt the Nancy Drew game that killed me the most, and I do not consider that a good thing. Nancy apparently can't even ride a bike or kayak unless you remind her every time to put her safety gear on. It gets a little old, particularly when you want to run off and explore a new clue, so you click on transportation only to die and then have to reload. The ending is very suspenseful, but a lot of it is left to chance (read reloading).I may as well finish up with the one other bad point, the puzzles. Some of them were quite good. But you get to a point where you're communicating directly on the phone with the person giving you some of these puzzles, and she refuses to tell you point blank what she wants, insisting that you must run hither, thither, and yon at her command, and thus keeping you from solving the mystery. Consider it a personality quirk, but I don't do pointless tasks in real life, and I don't consider them fun to do as part of a story in a game either. I lost all interest in completing that series of puzzles, and read the answers on a walkthrough so that I could get BACK to the mystery, which is the whole point of the game so far as I am concerned.Now to the positives: I'm not normally a science buff, but I enjoyed looking at samples under a microscope and describing them. The Whale World exhibit was beautiful and informative. The kayaking landscapes were also beautiful. The mystery was well-crafted, and the suspects are well developed and diversely modeled.

It's obvious that great care was taken to maintain the authenticity of the Star Trek Universe: Trek detail was as good as it gets.3. I felt I had plenty of interaction with Picard, although Data dropped out of the game pretty quickly. The character of Ensign Sovok was well developed and engaging. The game did a very professional job of making me feel that, through believable twists of fate, the future of the galaxy rested on my shoulders. I found myself wondering how my favorite Trek characters, when facing similar challenges, always manage to stay alive and make the right split-second decision every time. I felt drawn into the Star Trek world to a degree I have never experienced before.CONS --- 1. This was my first true action game. Although I primarily enjoy Myst-style games, I had always wondered if I was missing out on something by not playing action adventures. I managed to get about halfway through this game before I admitted defeat and used a cheat code that gave me invulnerability. I thought that this code would eliminate the combat, but instead my character just kept getting shot over and over, while grunting and spewing bits of impact debris all over the place. And I still needed to shoot other characters in order to progress. Although using the cheat code helped me get through the game, I found that it did not increase my enjoyment. I guess I just don't like killing things, not even virtual things (not even Evil virtual things).2. I thought that the keyboard interface was by far the most difficult aspect of the game. Although I've used the keyboard in other, more traditional adventure games, no other game I've tried demanded anything even close to the coordination and speed necessary here. Sometimes you are running, firing a weapon, and trying to access inventory all at the same time -- you really need three hands. And it's a good thing I couldn't fall off cliffs into the abyss -- I would have spent so much time restoring my game that I probably would have quit outright. Maybe the designers should have come up with a crawl mode for people like me. By the time I reached the &quot;stealth&quot; level late in the game, I still wasn't good enough with the keyboard to be able to complete the level. If I hadn't finally resorted to using one of my son's saved games, I probably would have been stuck there forever.BOTTOM LINE --- Hidden Evil is more oriented to the action gamer than to the traditional adventure gamer. If you are not experienced in using the keyboard as an input device, expect to face a stiff learning curve. However, if you are a Trek fan, and enjoy arcade/action challenges, this game is well worth your time and money.",software

Once i got threw the steps it is like falling off a log. Now you are not going to take an album that has been used as an ashtray and get opera hall sound. It does restore your albums to it's fullest potential! My only comment is if you are trying to stay true to your records you should'nt add all the EQ and Stereo effects, i think it just distorts the sound but experiment and you will probably come out where you wanna be i am not a perfectionist. However the cleaning aspects are great it can take many flaws out of the recording with the exception of deep pops but it can muffle them so they are not as pronounced. One of the best things about this prduct is that it registers the breaks by marking them between each track so you can play the full side and then pause the recording process flip the record to side two and begin that side by clicking pause again. WOW! You can even name each track indivdually in seconds for transfer to Mp3 album folders. If you are recording classical of acoustic music with silent moments within the track it is easy to delete certain markers so that you dont have false starts, i hope this info helps. It is a very afforable product that delivers on every promise just be patient it will come to you, Oh and make sure you buy a pre amp if you dont have one Circuit City sells a very nice General Electric one for about 30 bucks and it runs on a 9 volt battery.

I like how it adjusts itself as the room light changes. The USB cable is not really that long. Since I have an input on the side of my monitor, it's not an issue. If you have an older monitor and you don't have a USB input, you will most definitely need to buy an extension.After you view you color-corrected screen for several months, your eyes will become accustomed to it. Only then, when you switch back to your old calibration will you see how much of a difference the Huey PRO has made. When I turned the calibration off, my screen has a yellow tint. It's almost like they are two different LCD monitors--that's how much of a color difference there is.The only issues I have encountered are that the suction cups on the unit only worked for one day, now I have to physically hold the unit on the screen for the 45 second screen calibration procedure. It's not a big deal. Also, I don't know if it is my computer or the software but sometimes I have issues with the software not loading up at startup and I have to manually start it.

B00004T1MD,1/1,4.0,"I thoroughly enjoyed Beyond Atlantis. It was one of those games that had me eager to get back to it, night after night. The puzzles were challenging and inventive, requiring you to use multiple levels of thought. I really liked how the nature of the puzzles changed with each area you visited. For example, many of the Mayan puzzles were math-based, where the Celtic puzzles were more intuitive.The scenery was beautiful. And the dialog was exceptional. This is the only game I've run across with a Celtic setting that has not completely mangled Gaelic words and names. I also liked that you were given the option to replay all the dialog, so that you could pick up on things you might have missed the first time around.This game used mythology especially well, particularly in the Mayan and Celtic settings. Being something of a student of Celtic myth, I was really excited to see how well some of the characters and concepts were integrated here.Beyond Atlantis ran very smoothly. I've had a problem with some of Dreamcatcher's other games crashing for no apparent reason, but that, I'm happy to say, was not an issue with this one.The character animations were not to the level I would have expected, however. Characters often looked like bad claymation, and range of movement was limited. Also, the music, though lovely, consisted of short tape-loops that got a little crazy-making with repetition, particularly when you had to visit certain areas over and over to solve the puzzles.Though most of the puzzles were of the thinking variety, there were a few that just required you to &quot;muscle&quot; through, either by pixel-hunting or by repeating an action or series of actions until you got it right. I found the &quot;charging the crystal&quot; puzzle particularly annoying, as well as confusing. It was hard even to know where to begin with that one without resorting to a hint page.Still, for humour, integrated story, beautiful settings, and puzzles that will really keep you working at them for days, Beyond Atlantis is hard to beat.",software

B00006ULHT,1/1,1.0,"I have been a loyal TurboTax user for several years. Steer way clear of Turbo Tax 2002. The activiation process can be a nightmare, and support is of no help. I purchased my 2002 edition in early January, and proceeded to install it. However, the nightmare began when I got a new computer, and tried to reinstall Turbo Tax -- the product activation would not work. I placed several calls to support, and all ended with the same answer -- I must purchase another license to use the product on another computer. This product activation is dubious at best. The product ties itself to one computer and that is it. Am I supposed to keep the same computer for three years in case of an audit? and buy another license? I haven't used the one I bought. I will be pressing for a refund, and moving on to a competitor's product. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.",software
B0002UCSKI,1/2,1.0,"Okay... so I'm not as astute in the technical aspects of software as some reviewers, but I can say that my experience with this software is absolutely terrible.First off, it is built to integrate with Outlook, but doesn't really. It always leaves one e-mail in your outbox (the one you posted first). If you open your outbox before they send, then the one you posted most recently won't send either. Seriously, the only way I have been dealing with this is that I have left a dead e-mail in the box permanently. If I need to change something that has been posted to the outbox, I have to open it, then get out of the outbox, change it, and repost it, otherwise it won't send -- ever.I have set NIS so that it doesn't scan my outgoing e-mail, as it blocks anything over 2mb, and in my business, I send things that big all the time. In a recent update, however, it has reinstated that and now scans all of my outgoing e-mail whether it is set to or not.I spent hours and hours on the phone with (supposed) technicians, who refused to answer any questions unless I disabled my whole network. What that has to do with this program, I don't know. I tried the ""live internet chat"" function, but -- and I kid you not -- it took almost two hours for me to get ten responses from the guy. When I complained, he hung up on me. Gotta love that.When I tell NIS that something it has categorised as spam ""isn't spam"", it doesn't remember the sender's e-mail address, like it is supposed to. It just keeps calling it spam and quarantining it.Regarding spyware, I have another piece of anti-spyware software called Webroot Spy Sweeper, that routinely finds spyware on my computer that NIS didn't catch.This has just been one headache after another. Their customer service was unresponsive and totally unhelpful, with not ONE actual solution to any of these problems.The only piece of software I have ever bought that was anywhere close to as bad as this is WinFax 10, another Norton product.I will NEVER, EVER buy another piece of Norton/Symantec software again as long as I live.

B0009PD3PA,5/5,4.0,"There are a few excellent and detailed reviews already posted here, so I'll keep it short.My GPS setup includes PalmOne Treo 650, TomTom Navigator 5 and Holux GPSlim 236 Bluetooth receiver. I live in a big city (Toronto), so I often had to use Google Maps to plan my trips from point A to point B.TomTom calculates most routes in a matter of seconds and gets me where I want fast. If I miss a turn (and this happened a lot during the first week of use), it would either find an alternative route or ask me to make a U-turn when possible.I've been using it for about a month now and, overall, I'm very happy. One issue I had with it is that it asked me to make a left turn at a few intersections with ""No Left Turn"" signs. I was actually signalling and getting ready to turn then noticing the sign at the last minute, so keep your head up and don't put all your faith into the software.And of course, it doesn't take the traffic into consideration when figuring out your trip (unless you signed up for the optional TomTom traffic reports), so the TomTom-recommended route is not always the best one.Despite these minor flaws, it is a great product. I am impressed with the detailed maps, application speed and the ability to get wherever I want fast, without getting lost in a big city. Navigator 5 is a good investment.

B000E64ELG,1/2,2.0,"I had to reinstall windows xp on my system and had decided Norton was too expensive and interfered too much with some of my games. There was no way to turn off certain options and there were occasional pop-up notifications that irritated me to no end. Panda was great in this respect. It installed easily, virus definition updates took very little time, the program scanned my drives quickly and efficiently, and it was great for catching trojans, cookies and spyware.Unfortunately, it is a system hog. Start-up took over five minutes. Despite a successful boot and login, Windows would go to the desktop and it would look like everything was ready to go. But if you clicked on a program (IE, Outlook, anything) nothing would happen for about 4 minutes, and then suddenly everything you had clicked on would open up. This got progressively worse over the month I had Panda installed. Shut down time also began to increase.I uninstalled it, and all those problems went away -- definitely Panda. I'm now using NOD32 and it seems to be working great. I liked Panda more than Norton, but it essentially rendered my system unstable. It may work better on yours, but consider this fair warning. In fairness, I did not contact customer support, so that may have helped fix whatever the problem was.Pros: Good interface; quick updates; effective protection; good amount of customizationCons: System hog; may lead to system stability problems.",software

When I first called up the company they said I didnot need to know any programming.I explained I did some FrontPage work on weekends as a hobby and I wanted to have some freedom in designing my webpages,(I could have gone for ecommerce custom built sites offered over the internet,but I wanted to design my site to some extent) but at the same time I did not want to be in any way involved in the technical details of ecommerce which should be handled by their product.

B0002RQ0WS,18/22,5.0,"I have been using GoBack since the mid or late 1990s--I believe it was first sold by Adaptec before Roxio took it over and now Norton sells it. GoBack 4 is the first upgrade by Norton. This is a great product which reverts your hard drive to a state before a problem developed in your hard drive and so will make the problem go away. System restore is okay but GoBack will revert everything on your hard drive not just certain files, so more problems can be corrected, and you can also selectively recover files even if they have been emptied from the recycle bin without having to revert your hard drive. Another advantage is that GoBack loads before Windows so if there is a severe problem with Windows you can still restore Windows to a healthy state. This upgrade has increased the default storage space for a healthy revert from 4GB to 8GB--this means you can go back further in time--from a few days to a week or more depending on your file activity, and has added a few new bells and whistles. I installed GoBack 4 about a week ago and have already used it twice. Aside from antivirus programs, this is the best utility that you can buy.Update 1/1/11:There is a newer product called Rollback Rx which does the same thing as GoBack and has the advantage of using very little space on your hard drive.

I'm 24 and I bought this because I liked the idea of having a simple, mouse-driven baseball game to play in boring lecture classes while I pretend to take notes.Let me just say, if you enjoy baseball games at all, you'll like this game. Everything's been made cute and clean and colorful for kids, but underneath the shiny exterior is a very well made arcade baseball game. You have a variety of players that are rated in various categories, each with their own strength and weaknesses, to draft for your team. The game has a full, continuous-season mode that, while lacking any new rookies or trading mechanism, is still made fun thanks to the surprisingly complete statistic tracking and award certificates (which allow you to unlock new players.) You can make all the basic managerial decisions including deciding what positions to play players at, making pitching substitutions and setting your batting order.And underneath what is a solid simulation-like package, rests a simple yet deep game. You have full control over pitching and fielding, a 3 dimensional strike zone for hitting, arcade-like power-ups for both pitching and hitting and variable difficulty levels which allow you to turn on and off things like a ball locator when batting.All in all, if you're looking for an intense, simulation-driven baseball game that captures the feel of the majors, you probably never bothered even looking at this page.

The program seems to run much more smoothly than previous versions, and it has a new slim-line look. It is superior for veiwing DVDs, editing digital films, or even the casual word processing. It is very user friendly, with upgraded tutorials and online help included. Mr. Gates certainly has outdone himself this time...With every product, however, comes disadvantages. I have only found two. First, since it is not DOS based, it is unable to run many old video games. However, by not beind DOS based it is more userfriendly and dependable. Secondly, the graphics orientated nature can really drain a battery.I highly recommend upgrading to this product. I am sure you will not be disappointed.

Before I got this, my dad's computer had such bad pop-ups that the internet would freeze, my sister got a nasty virus that required that she wipe her hard drive. And I got some nasty bug that got into my start-up menu and wouldn't let me turn off my laptop without restarting about 5 + times. But ever since we installed the firewall, no one has had a major computer problem.

The program used only a VGA (640 X 480) window in the middle of the screen. To compensate for the lack of screen real estate they have a complicated system of procedures to scroll the small window over the tabletop.

B000HJQYE0,2/4,1.0,"I read the reviews about how buggy this software was, but I only needed a small fraction of it to work to get around some features missing from Vista. Well, the few things I needed crashed, and worse it changed the system defaults so that a bunch of things that were working with Vista defaults were switched to roxio programs, that didn't work. It even added a bunch a things t autostart when I logged in and they crashed too, everytime I logged in.I can't believe Microsoft rated this dog Vista compatible. I suspect that one piece of software was rated compatible, and then Rosio slapped the compatible label on a box filled with junk. Note that their setup program doesn't let you select what to install in any useful way, so you can't tell it to not install programs that overwrite system defaults or run programs automatically. You can't even turn off the autostart programs with their options dialogs. The Roxio UI was clearly not designed for Vista, nor users apparently. It doesn't explain thinsg easily enough for new users, nor provide the level of detail required by advanced users.I uninstalled Roxio, and I've now spent a week trying to get Vista working again. I finally got DVDs burning, but Roxio did something low-level that always formats blank CDs in a format incompatible with my MP3 CD players, and I haven't been able to fix it in a week of searching newsgroups and playing with the Registry.

B000078COJ,0/0,4.0,"Language learning isn't an all in one source. Even the expensive Rosetta Stone software requires that you get a language grammar book to truly understand a language.I have had this program for five years. I used the software to assist in learning three languages (Italian, Spanish, and French). I plan to use it to learn many more.It's a tool to aid in learning. My first attempt to use this lead to frustration. The instructions are not well laid out and takes some fiddling to figure out what to do. It doesn't give you a ""Start Here to learn a new language."" Nor does it attempt to teach you in a step by step manor. I gave up trying to use it as a all-in-one product. I used grammar workbooks and a 'learn as you drive' system. After doing those, I went back to this software.The Pros: So many tools for a low price (and languages!) (I picked mine up from bargain bin at a much higher price and consider it a value for what I paid.)1) Wonderful dictation system in which your inflection and pronounciation can be rated via a microphone. Either by word or entire phrase.2) A 'slow' option to get a handle on the phrases before speading it up to conversation level.3) Conversations you would use in everday situations while traveling (None of that ""The monkey is in the tree"" junk.)4) Word by word or phrase by phrase play back.5) Games (caveat to this in the cons though).6) The licensing (or lack there of). I work in software license management and I think what Rosetta Stone has done in locking their application is absolutely ridiculous. People have needs to change their systems and language learning is a lifetime process. I have used this program for five years and had to reinstall it at least once per year for system or hardware changes. There are better ways to enforce licensing.Cons1) All the material (and answers to the games) is in the dialogs. So you will have to complete all the dialogs and memorize them to get the answers.2) Locked open; you can't minimize or make it the inactive window to 'listen and do something else'. It wants to be the focus of your attention and is programmed to do so.3) It doesn't focus on step by step learning.4) You have to poke around to figure out how to use it; it's not intuitive.It's a great tool once you have a handle on the basics. I come back to it time and again because it helps to flesh out my basic books and CDs.Items in my language toolbox.1) Dictionary - English vs Current language of study2) Learn as you drive CDs for listening as I do other things.3) Language grammar workbooks; written is just as important to understanding as listening.4) Phrase books (even better if they come with an audio CD). It aids in understanding how to put the sentences together and offers a phonetic view of the language.5) Other source material (This program falls under that category; along with movies, newspapers, and music CDs in the language of study).",software

The next problem was that it doesn't remember what level of the game the child last played at and starts over at level one every time. This is bad for two reasons. One is that many children get comfortable at a level and don't want to move on to the next, more challenging level. The parent ought to be able to change it once and not have to keep changing it every time. Not only that, you have to go into the game to change the level and then it plays the instructions yet again for the next level. It's true that you can click through all that but it's very annoying. Also, what is the point of having the confirmation every time the child leaves a game? It's not like they're going to lose some valuable data. They can just get back in if they want. Being asked all the time is also annoying.On the positive side, there are enough activities in the game. And there were a few sound-oriented games that I thought were pretty nice and unusual.

The program is not as useful for photos or documents; in fact, photos that look quite good in Preview often don't look as good in Photoshop, which makes editing a bit difficult. My Epson scanner software usually produces as a good a result as I am going to get for most items. Of course, if you want to alter a photo(and ""Photoshop"" has become a synoym for alteration), Photoshop is very good.

I remember using Tiger for 2 yrs. before it crashed on me; Leopard took just a few days and regularly crashes critical applications (Safari, Mail, and MS Office are the usual culprits); and the OS itself takes a dive every so often too. It's surprising behavior for OS X, given my previous experience with Panther and Tiger. Nevertheless, for features and ease of use it can't be matched; and it remains the safe choice for virus-free, malware-free computing and web browsing.The big problem with Apple remains its paranoid defense of its proprietary territory and what I call ""death by a thousand charges"" -- $80 every two years or so for updates to iLife, iWork if you have it; the annual charges for the pathetic MobileMe; and the fee to get yourself to the front of the line at their genius bars. Apple was once distinguished by a community spirit, top-shelf customer service, and a departure from the corporate mob. Today, Linux is home to those virtues and Apple plays in the same moneyed muck as M$, and it shows in the quality of their products, which steadily declines with time and greed.",software

B0001BFDAU,3/3,4.0,"Musical Talents,i used to use Opcode's Studiovision Pro for my MIDI and when Gibson bought out Opcode and ceased production of their MIDI software, I went to Steinberg. I now use Cubebase SX3. It is emensly flexible, has many sounds and effects, records audio, has many mixing options and, unfortunatly, (...) and requires an expirianced MIDI engineer to get good results.On the opposit side of the world is Garage Band, a drag-and-paste music creation tool that is only a fraction of the Apple program available as Ilife. It includes about 1000 canned sounds that can be assembled together and called Music.Soundtrack meets a middle ground. For about [$$$], you get about 4,000 samples to drag and drop into a timeline on multiple tracks to creat music. It is great fun and useful for backround tracks, but you must accept the provided melodies. Soundtrack, unlike even Garage Band, has no means by which you can create YOUR melodies. You can not use a keyboard interface to create a melody. It is a great loss that earned Soundtrack only 4 stars from me. I found no intros or exits from certain genre of music. In consolation, I'll admitt that you can supply Soundtrack many menues of downloaded and/or purchased blocks of music in the ACID, WAV (and other) professional samples. From there, you'll find an almost endless list of expasion sounds for a price.I use Soundtrack, which was an added bonus in my Final Cut Pro 3 program, and I use Cubase SX 3 for any true musical compositions, But I recommend Garage Band over Soundtrack for anyone who desires to ""make their own music"" and can connect a cheap MIDI keyboard to their system. With the added sound effects in the optional expansion set of sound blocks, they may be quite satisfied.P.S.: I don't own Garage Band (yet!)Mark.........................................................................................................................",software

The series is not as good as the movies; because of the changes in the aliens voices and alot of the cast that was in the movies were not in the series. I thought the first 12 episodes were good, because Lane Smith's character, Nathan Bates, the mole who plays both side. The problem with this series is they killed off Nathan Bate's in episode 13; and the series just didn't make sense after that. I believe that's why it only lasted 1 season, eventhough Donovan, Diana, Willie, and Julie were there throughout it still couldn't save it from the chopping block. They did try to help it some by brining Frank Ashmore back as Martin's twin Brother; but it just wasn't enough.

B000B5NS2G,11/13,5.0,"I recently installed Norton Internet Security 2006 from CD as an upgrade from Norton Internet Security 2002. I was simply resubscribing each year, but this year they wouldn't let me -- no more support for NIS 2002. I had to buy the new software. I won't cry, I got my money's worth out of the old version, and I wanted to try out their new anti-spyware features anyway.The install worked (almost) fine. I uninstalled the old version first, a good procedure with any software, to keep your registry clean and avoid problems. I also shut off the power to the broadband modem. They don't tell you to do this, but your computer is wide open from the moment the old version is uninstalled until the new software is running. A good precaution to take. After the uninstall it tells you to restart Windows. Did that, but when I put the new CD in it said I couldn't install yet because I didn't restart Windows. Did that again, put the new CD in, same message. Finally I powered the computer down and back on, and the install was happy after that.The product has worked like a champ. There is a performance hit (as others here have commented) but I don't find it to be excessive on a 3GHz class Pentium. When you consider everything it has to do while you surf, to expect otherwise would be to ask for miracles.The spyware detection works better than I expected. I use Ad-aware and Spybot, both excellent freeware programs. Norton detected some leftover garbage that those two missed. That said, I will continue to use all three. Spyware is especially difficult to accurately detect without false positives, more so than viruses, and a layered approach is good. I have several small children that can never say no to any popup that offers a free game, and cleaning up all the spyware that comes with those free goodies has historically been a big challenge for me.As for the criticism from some reviewers about difficulties uninstalling Norton: not to blow it off, but I would cut Norton some slack. Many virus attacks go straight for the jugular -- the first thing they do is attempt to knock out the anti-virus software. As a result Norton (and all other products) must walk a fine line between knowing when to gracefully step down and when to defend itself with every means in its arsenal. Obviously they don't always get it perfect.Two other pieces of unsolicited advice related to the topic:Stop using Outlook or Outlook Express for e-mail. Server-based e-mail works just fine, and the e-mail has much less chance of infecting your computer.Second, consider switching your default browser to Firefox. It's free and 100% compatible with Internet Explorer. I've found it to be much more resistant to unintended spyware downloads.",software

B000JX3N02,0/0,4.0,"This program isn't at the level of Norton Utilities, but then again Norton has gone downhill so far it really isn't worth buying anymore. Fix-It is a decent utility to replace the disk checker and defragmenter; the defragmenter isn't the greatest in the world, but it's MUCH better than the abysmal one that Vista comes with. It also has some other handy utilities like a media verifier that tries to access all files on a piece of media so you can tell if a CD is scratched too badly to read for example and a utility to make sure your clock is set properly. Probably my favorite is the Startup Commander. It was able to easily stop an annoyingly persistent little program Roxio installed from loading on startup, when msconfig wouldn't find it. Very nice.It also works as a bootable CD which is supposed to allow you to use their partitioning software, but that doesn't work on mine. It's got a hardware tester and a SMART checker to determine if your hard drive is failing. The former is nearly worthless, the latter completely worthless as it wouldn't even get any info from any drives on two different computers. It also runs an annoying tray icon, but that's an easily terminated service (Start/Run/services.msc and look for Fix-it). I still don't trust it entirely with the Registry because of bad experiences with other utilities suites in the past, but everything it's done so far has caused no problems.When you add in anti-virus (maybe older version of Trend Micro?) and anti-spyware (I didn't install those features) and the 3 user license, this is a pretty decent software suite for the money.

B000077DD5,16/23,5.0,"I received this (Rosetta Stone Japanese Levels 1 & 2) as an gift from my fiance a few months ago. Since I had already taken 3 years of Japanese at my university (and had spent last summer in Japan), initially I thought the Level 1 would be pretty much useless to me, and I imagined I probably would start somewhere in Level 2, and only in a couple years when I would start forgetting my Japanese. However, when I installed the program and started from the *very first lesson* on Level 1, I found myself learning a few new things! I went through the first unit and continued to learn more words & terms. Also, the writing and reading drills using the ""kanji"" setting really help me review my kanji.So in a nutshell: for a person who already knows some Japanese, this program, is really really useful.

B0002ZALES,4/4,4.0,"I have played a few other Drew games, in comparison, this is quite a complicated game.I played ""The secret of the Old Clock"" before this, and breezed through it. I played ""Treasue in a Haunted Mansion"" (after Blackmoor) and found it too boring and quit.The game does deal with Astronomy, Astrology, Botany, Typing, Research, Memory, Geometry and a lot of Mathematical word problem solving skills.The authors of the game did create a spooky enviornment, which is no easy feat for a point and click QVR slide show game. I actually thought something or someone was going to pop out and grab me just around the next corner throughout the entire game.Some of these puzzles are very complicated and really quite involved. It is going to be difficult and challenging for the average adult much less a teen. It requires more reading and studying the other Drew games I played.As far as game mechanics, I'm not a fan of point and clicks in general. I would have preferred to have Nancy move in a 3rd person 3-D enviornment much like the early Amaze-Know Wonder Potter games. I did find the frame loads distracting. But as far as the point and clicks go, Nancy is definitely the most fun and ""Blackmoor"" the most challenging of the lot.As far as subject matter, they could have transferred the subject matter to a farm, and renamed it ""Nancy Drew and the Curse of the Bale of Hay"" and no one would have bought it. I personally don't know anything about astrology or the occult and I played ""Blackmoor"", and I still don't know anything about those subjects. While I did recognize the names of some major star constellations, my guess is the authors just made most of the stuff up (as JK Rowling did for the Potter series). The game is as innocuous as those ""Haunted House"" rides at the amusement parks (for those of us way too chicken to go on the big really scary roller coaster).A year after Blackmoor's release, EA's Potter fiasco ""Goblet of Fire"" movie coordinated game had a quest (in regular gameplay) called the ""Vanishing Cards"" or find the cards before they vanish. The concept definitiely was borrowed from Blackmoor's ""13 Ghosts"" or find the ghosts before they vanish side quest. I found it interesting that the only quest requiring minimal thought (in that debacle) was borrowed from Nancy Drew.Other games have borrowed ideas from Blackmoor, also. The game is almost a reference point for many games that came after it.There's a lot to do. There's so much to do, I wished I had something else to look at, that encompassed a larger area, instead of taking on new challenges in the same space.I wish I could give Blackmoor 4 1/2 stars, but there is no provision for that.MJH",software

I use Director 8.5 for animating 2D fun stuff.The Good:1. It's very easy and comes with a lot of built in features such as fade in and fade out.2. The timeline is like a score if you use Director.3. It's very simple and easy to master.4. Thank God you don't need to script in any computer language.5. You can easily do tons of stuff at once.Now for the bad:1. I'm used to dragging the item not seeng a see through version of the characters (cast). I can't stand that when you click straight that it shows the transparent version right on top of the original.2. You can't drag your pictures to the background area or use them as backgrounds.3. There is no proberties option to make something Matte or Transparent etc. option like in Director when you're animating. So when ever you draw something in a program like paint it comes out when you try dragging it on the screen to be bordered in white.So the goods out do the bads so I took away one star. It's still a fine program, but with some annoying options that are clearly not in there. I reccomend this to people who want to make a website quickly in a short time.Director is a very good animating program and you can do a lot more stuff in it with animating. It says on the Motionartist box ""Flash animation in minutes"" which is true when you think about it, but it is not a serious animating program like making flash movies for the internet. Oh yeah this is also pretty good for making presentations too.",software
B000192RRE,2/2,3.0,"I bought this product for the huge collection of clip-art, photographs, and fonts. Then I opened the box to find a fraction of what I was promised. It wasn't long before I realized that no, I was not missing any discs, and I was not happy to say the least. Instead of a vast library to install on my hard drive, I was directed to the website clipart.com where I could download what I needed.The box mentions that instead of giving you a lot of discs you can download images from the Internet, and an Internet connection is listed as a system requirement, but there is no clear indication of the fact that this box contains only a portion of the promised 2.5 million images. This is misleading to say the least, and as I said, I was not happy.But once I got past the initial outrage (and once you realize that no, you are not missing any discs), I realized that this product comes with a whopping FULL YEAR subscription to the website--a $100 value--for the mere $30 I paid. THIS IS A TERRIFIC VALUE!If only they had been more clear on the box as to what you were buying. Maybe they'll sell more this way, but look at all the dissatisfied customers.Oh, and the image browsing program included with the set...well, I'm sure they spent at least an hour developing it, but if you have Windows XP there is absolutely no reason to install it.",software

B00002SA1K,1/1,4.0,"Pros: I am a K-5 music teacher at a school district in Texas and have used Jumpstart Music with ALL grade levels with much success. The Kindergartners must have prior instruction with the rhythms before attempting to use this. However, after a few lessons to prepare, they were very successful. I recently allowed by 4th and 5th graders to use it and they were completely happy with it. Even though they saw it only goes to third grade level when first putting your name in the system, they realized pretty quickly that many of the rhythms go beyond 3rd grade level. They were challenged and for many who came from another district and perhaps had no prior music training, it is a great way to get them caught up with the class.Cons: The only negative thing I can say about this has to do with the sounds they make for the rhythms (i.e. ha...haha....for quarter note and two eighth notes). However you CAN turn the voices off and remind the students to say the rhythms the way they were taught in class.Great program!! I highly recommend it!!!Dallaslady",software

I normally wait a while before leaving a review, but I was pretty impressed.I bought Version 8 instead of 9 because it was a lot cheaper and from what I read the only real difference was that you had to train in 8 but not in 9.I was dictaing an email to my mom within 30 minutes. Install, scanning my files for my writing style, reading the General training passages and watching the entire tutorial only took 30 minutes.The Email I dictated included the words Esophageal Inflammation and Dragon got it on the first try.There are additional trainings available to improve accuracy in the program. I will run them later, but out of the box only using general training was pretty accurate. I also tend to speak fairly fast and it was able to keep up with me (where some of my coworkers cannot)without my having to talk..... like...... a...... robot.The only thing I noticed so far is that when natural punctuation is turned on, it didn't always acknowledge the end of my sentences.

It's really quite a good game, and pleasant to use while waiting for Exile, which is why I bought it.I DID end up using a cheat site 6 times, but if I had turned up the brightness sooner, half of them would not have been necessary. I found the hints on the Dreamcatcher site to be spoilers, and didn't look twice. There is an excellent hint site for many games ... ... You can progress from the barest nudge to the answer in gradual steps, which is what I like in a hint site. I am in China, now, and hope not to use so many hints. I think there's a learning curve. I used a lot of hints in Myst, but only a couple in Riven, as I became used to the logic of the puzzles and the flow of the game.Some reviewers say it is shallow, but I find myself totally immersed, and losing track of time! I loved the monks, and thought they were very sympathetic characters! The other characters probably weren't supposed to be sympathetic. They were all sort of larger than life myth/saga characters, except for the birdman, Fintan. I liked him, and felt very sorry for him! (And Bres reminded me of a boss I used to have, especially when he got mad!) And I LOVED the Dali-esque world inside the Book - after I turned up the brightness!I will say that I do not find the game as intuitive as the Myst games, but that may just be my particular thought processes!

B00005LJEL,3/3,4.0,"We are a loyal Reader Rabbit family, having tried many children's software titles and consistently finding the RR series at least as good as any similar software and usually much better, but I would say this particular title is a mixed bag. On the positive side, the graphics are good, the characters are familiar and there is an overarching purpose (collecting brillites to plug into Mount Brill) that lends depth to a typically shallow gaming genre. On the not-so-positive side, the games are often exceptionally tedious and it is not always clear what one is expected to do. I really appreciate that there's a framework story and a big finish with a &quot;Congratulations&quot; to help your child get excited about the accomplishment but, as another reviewer has mentioned, the child can easily get the brillites needed to finish the game while they still have another (and incomplete) set of stones -- what are those for?There are six activities that rely on matching, counting and letter recognition skills as well as listening to instructions, but there is little devotion to teaching these skills -- it's basically just testing them. I'd say this is one of the weaker members of a strong software series .... perhaps not the first program that you might want to buy for your preschooler, but entertaining and with some positive attributes if you're shopping for a third or fourth.",software
B000067PF3,1/1,4.0,"I purchased this product for my almost 4 year old boy. He loves Jay Jay, in general, and has enjoyed the game, also.The only problem I can see with the game, so far, is that one of the 5 or so games you need to complete in order to ""win"" is hard for ME to complete as an adult - - even at the lowest level. In it a downhill skier needs to quickly click on the correct numbered flag as they fly by. Although my child can correctly identify the numbers he is supposed to be clicking on, his hand-eye coordination isn't what it needs to be to be able to succeed...or even begin to progress through that game. The other games are all age appropriate and fun and he enjoys them.The only possible other problem I could see is that a child much older than 4 would probably get through the games too quickly and then become bored with it, although I am making this comment knowing that there are 3 levels to the games and we have only tried the 1st level.Overall, I give this game a high rating for being kid-friendly (with the exception of the skiing game) fun, educational, and SAFE for kids to use without parental guidance/supervision.",software

I encountered none of the mentioned problems, as a matter of fact I have been impressed with the easy installation. Once installed, navigation is easy and logical; my piano students have no problems using the program by themselves, without much tutoring. Everything is easy to read, graphics are good, audio is good, video clips are short but interesting, they work perfectly fine on my computer! I especially like the fact that every musical style period, every instrument and every musical term is not only explained but also pronounced (correctly!) - really helpful for music lovers who haven't had the good luck of a formal musical education. There is so much information here: history, lots of instruments (some of which were new to me), composers, detailed biographies, musical terms, etc. Most of the instruments do have audio and/or video examples.Music lovers and music teachers alike will find this program useful and enjoyable. Some of my elementary-age students disliked that it is not truly &quot;interactive&quot; in the sense that the program would &quot;respond&quot; to you. However, it is a wonderful encyclopedia with a wealth of information and options to cater to your particular interest.

B000B642OI,5/5,4.0,"Reading the other reviews here I got a bit nerveous about having ordered the game. Some of them speak of problems getting the game to run, while others sound almost like they were made by the developer to promote it.Luckily when I got the game it ran just fine. No crashes yet, having played around 80 of the levels.It's a nice, slower paced game to relax with after some hours of action games. Some of the puzzles can be a bit tricky but that just makes it more satisfying to finally solve them.Summing up my impressions: Game works fine on my year old PC running WinXP Home. It's a different kind of game from most I play (RPGMMO, shooters and strategy). It's fun to play around with all the gadgets and tools. Might have limited replay value once you find the best (simplest) solution for the puzzles.

B00081G38Y,17/22,1.0,"Very disappointing release! I have been a GoLive user for going on two years now and after a long waiting period, CS2 is finally upon us. Unfortunately, CS2 did not herald the bug fixes and core improvements so many GoLive users have been waiting for.The most glaring problem is that GoLive CS2 still does not have a history feature. Even ridiculously simple functions like previewing your in-development pages make it impossible to revert to a previous state and undo any mistakes. Perform a find/replace and again, once you commit to the replace you cannot undo the change.What is the point of previewing your webpage if you can't go back and correct a mistake? It is this kind of blatant oversight that damns GoLive to being a subpar program that just doesn't feel as intuitive or polished as other Adobe products.There have been a number of small improvements (such as an advanced CSS library) but those changes cannot make you overlook the fact that at its core, GoLive CS2 is a buggy and fundamentally broken product that fails to deliver on every level.Another poor showing.

If you are looking for a software that allows you to manage your pictures, make movies, post things on the internet, and be able to access them, you will not find a more user-friendly program anywhere.With iLife, you can edit your pictures. You can order copies with just a click of a button. With just another click, you can e-mail them to anyone in your e-mail address book. Another click you can post them on a web-sight for your friends to see. In addition, you can set your pictures, web sights to your favorite music in iTunes and load them on your iPod and taken them anywhere.Speaking of iTunes - . if you haven't discovered iTunes yet go to Apple's home page and check it out. iTunes makes it easier and more affordable to buy music.

It isn'tThis software has potential, but Adobe released it before insuring it is reliable and stable. Within 5 minutes of installing this software and running it, Windows 2000 popped up the dreaded Blue Screen of Death. As a side note, it takes some pretty poorly written software to crash Windows 2000, and this is the first software to crash my system in over 9 months! Other than this ""software"", my system has always been rock solid.I did get it running on a laptop with XP, however it still exhibited buggy behavior, e.g. dialog boxes that didn't go away after the function was completed.I even downloaded the most recent patch as of 4/23/03 and the description of issues corrected discussed instability problems. Still, the patch wasn't enough. After installing the patch, and finally re-installing the software and re-installing the patch, it's just as unstable as it ever was. If I'm lucky, Photoshop Album just shuts down with an unexpected error, or locks up so I can terminate it. Worst case, it creates a fault so severe Windows 2000 crashes. In my opinion, any software that crashes an OS this robust should go directly to the trash heap.Fortunately, with rebates, I didn't pay much for this software, but I'm giving up on it in lieu of waiting for Adobe to come out with yet another patch that may or may not fix my problem. Instead, I'm going with ACDSee 5.0. I've used 3.1 for years and found it to be vastly more capable AND STABLE than Adobe.If you're running Windows 2000, beware. It may be a combination of software and hardware, but it's been a long time since anything has gummed up my PC like this product. Adobe should have spent a few more months in beta testing before rushing this product to market. Maybe by Version 2.0 they'll have something that's worthwhile.

B000F78O1K,10/10,4.0,"I have been using the trial version for about a week now. There is a learning curve with regards to the original setup for the field names and columns names to fit the user's choices vs. the default setup. In my case the best feature of this application is the ability to import an existing database. I have nearly 1,000 items in the 20 year old program I am currently using, and none of the home inventory programs I have tried do not provide any method of importing an existing database. I have no desire to re-enter every item, and all of the details of each item of my current database into a new program.The best part of this program is that you can import any existing database via a spreadsheet created from an exported file of your existing program. My current program exports all data to a .txt file which in turn can be converted by MS Excel to a comma delimited spreadsheet. I saved the spreadsheet as a .txt file, a .csv file, and as an .xls file. This program can import access (.mdb), excel (.xls), and comma delimited text (.csv) files. I tried the .xls file first which worked fine with one exception. The serial number field appears to be formatted as a number only field and when imported would only show serial numbers that did not have any alpha characters in the serial number. So I emailed tech support and I received a reply the next day advising I should try using the .csv file spreadsheet as the import rather than the .xls file. I did as they said and the import worked great, including all of the serial numbers.This import feature alone is worth the price of this application in my opinion. As the other reviewer wrote, yes there are some bugs, but nothing that I was not able to deal with, and did not cause any problems to the program as a whole. The only thing I have not tried and can not comment on would be the backup and restore process which saves the database in a ""zip"" file. So based on the low price, and the great import feature, I feel this program deserves 5 stars, but reduced by 1 because of the bugs.",software

B000I4PAQC,26/34,5.0,"Although I was somewhat apprehensive about purchasing this product because of the negative reviews, I spent the dough and waited anxiously for the UPS man to show up.A couple of days later my package arrived via the turd-brown truck and was deposited into my eager clutches.I sprinted up the rickety staircase of our 1896 Victorian, only pausing long enough to request a large rum and coke from my wife, then gleefully tore into my new software.After the simple one-step download, I started up the program and was presented with the daunting task of doing something with the blank page staring back at me.Not being the type to read all the manuals and necessary information before diving into a project, I glanced at the quick-start information and immediately went to work.The controls were extremely intuitive and I easily created the foundation. Upon this I laid the second floor and roof in minutes.Because of my home's unique Victorian porches, rails, and stacked bay windows, I did have to find specific information in the manual to address those details. All answers were simple to find thanks to the software's search menu. Simply type your topic and answers are sorted by relevance.The paper manual is also a great reference and has an index to find specific answers. I believe the entire manual is contained in the ""help"" search, but I don't actually know. I do know that every difficulty I encountered was easily solved by using the search bar.My original plan was to build a practice model to get comfortable with the software, then create another file with specific dimensions. This became unnecessary as the day progressed because it is so simple to input dimensions and insert walls, windows, doors, etc.Once the shell of my house was made, I grabbed my tape measure, went outside, and measured the dimensions of the foundation, doors, windows, etc.Back inside on Punch I simply lengthened walls, raised ceilings, stretched windows, and entered exact dimensions. With that, my Punch house was an exact duplicate of my home.The process continued with measuring interior spaces and dropping walls into place.The 2 story house with exact interior and exterior dimensions took about 5 hours to complete. This includes learning how to use the software on a basic level, manually measuring every surface in the house, consuming multiple and increasingly potent rum beverages and repeatedly complaining to my wife that my stomach was empty and needed solid nourishment. Had I been sober at the time the process may have been more expedient. There was quite a bit of unnecessary stalling because I simply was in no condition to go outside and measure.Once the exact shell was created, the program really came to life.There are huge menus of colors, textures, materials, fixtures, appliances, etc, that are infinitely customizable.In fact, once the shell was made, my wife shambled over with a large glass of wine, muttered something incoherent, and bumped me out of my chair. With a few simple instructions:A) ""these are your materials and color menus""B) ""drag and drop what you want where you want it""she quickly and expertly painted the rooms using Sherman Williams actual paint library. The colors are identified by name and product number so you can go to the Sherman Williams and request ""UPS turd-brown 60097"" *not an actual SW color* and be in and out of the store in minutes, not weeks. It makes the agonizing chore of choosing colors simple and relatively painless.Not only that, it's great fun to see all the possibilities without all the back-breaking, mind-numbing manual labor involved in actually painting a room only to hate it and repaint it.Other features such as the landscape design are worth the cost of the program on their own. I completely changed my landscape plans and gardenhouse placement once I saw them in 3-D. That alone saved me thousands of dollars.I highly recommend this product if you are planning a remodel. The materials choices are phenomenal, the ability to instantly change, tweak, and customize designs is simple and extremely useful in the planning process.Buy it. Ignore the bad reviews. If I can learn this program while drunk, you can surely do it.",software

Intuit's phased out QIF support because it is an outdated format. As a consumer, I DON'T CARE. Just make it work. My choices were to enter my 401k entries for the last 2 years manually by hand, or shell out money to buy Quicken 2004 that support QIF import, then upgrade to Quicken 2007. I already paid $60 for the software to help with my hectic day to day life; not to make it worse.There's no transaction merging feature after all downloaded transactions has been accepted.

You can't select the duplicate entries in each account and make them merge into one. How can the company Intuit make their software so un-Intuitive?

B00029XAUG,53/55,3.0,"The manufacturer's description of this software reprinted on amazon's website and on the software box states that one of its key features is that you can ""Scan sheet music for transposing or rearranging."" I bought the software based in large part on this representation. I realized there was a potential problem when I found that the manual that comes with the program has nothing on scanning. I then followed the ""help"" suggestions contained on the disk to scan a page of a perfectly legible printed part in 6/8 meter. I ended up with a part in 4/4 that added rests and dotted notes to make up the difference in the time signature. The scanning software also changed the key signature arbitrarily at various points, left out whole measures and changed others. When I tried to convert the scan into 6/8, it added even more wrong data. I tried calling the ""free"" telephone support, which is a long distance call. They weren't able to help over the phone, and offered to try to work with the file by email. Ultimately they told me that only their professional software would properly convert a scan of this music. I told them that this appears to be a serious bug -- how can you represent that your software scans music, when it turns every 6/8 part into a 4/4 part and you end up having to edit virtually every measure? I haven't gotten any response.",software

B00007K3A7,9/59,5.0,"StoryView 2.0 ha sido muy &uacute;til para mi trabajo de guionista y cuentista. Su disposici&oacute;n obliga a plantearse la historia en t&eacute;rminos de unidades y fragmentos jerarquizados. Por supuesto, no es una norma o una estrategia creativa dictatorial. Es una herramienta &uacute;til y uno puede tomarla o dejarla. En todo caso, es muy valiosa.Es interesante utilizar StoryView tanto para la creaci&oacute;n como para el an&aacute;lisis. Determinado gui&oacute;n de una pel&iacute;cula que hayas conseguido puedes dividirlo en escenas, secuencias, actos, etc. De manera tal de tener un mapa general de la disposici&oacute;n de la obra.Si conoces alg&uacute;n modelo narrativo, puedes dise&ntilde;ar una jerarqu&iacute;a y aplicarla -como plantilla- a tu narraci&oacute;n, como el de Joseph Campbell/Christopher Vogler, o el tradicional de tres actos de Syd Field. O puedes crear tu propia estructura, que es lo que hago cuando escribo narraciones literarias. Las unidades, se crean solos. Cap&iacute;tulos, eventos, secciones, actos, episodios, etc, lo que desees.Lo interesante es que el software se adapta plenamente a las ideas del escritor, se amolda. Puedes ordenar tu narraci&oacute;n en un solo nivel, o bien en varios, como las capas o layers de Photoshop.Tiene dos vistas, la Outline Window, que se asemeja mucho al &quot;Documento maestro&quot; de Word; y la otra, la TimeLime Window es como la marca de f&aacute;brica de Storyview, que es la vista de la disposici&oacute;n de tu narraci&oacute;n, en unidades de tiempo, p&aacute;gina, minutos, o lo que se desee. Puede importarse y exportarse documentos txt, rtf, en formato Movie Magic Screenwriter y otros.Lo &uacute;nico que le falta, a mi juicio, es un sistema multiplantilla, en el que uno pueda ajustar o aplicar determinada disposici&oacute;n de estructura a la historia, ejemplo, aplicar el modelo Joseph/Campbell, el tradicional, el de Dramatica, alguno personal, as&iacute; como cuando uno aplica diversos filtros a una imagen RGB o CMYK, con cierto nivel de &quot;transparencia&quot; o &quot;opacidad&quot;. Es decir, tenemos dos coordenadas, 1)tiempo y 2) unidades narrativas. Podr&iacute;a a&ntilde;adirse -opcionalmente, claro- modelos narrativos.

B00005RHDR,9/9,5.0,"Over the last several years I have had experience with Corel Draw, Photo Paint, & Ventura. I have also slugged it out with Paint Shop Pro 3.x,4.x,5.x &7.x, and Photoshop LE.I tried the rest, but was driven to the best. The Adobe Publishing Collection does it all. Photoshop is the standard. Paint Shop Pro is a marvel for the Price, but Photoshop's interface is the clear winner if you are working with large numbers of images. So, too, the filters run immesurably faster in Photo Shop. On my machine, the Salt & Pepper filter in Paint Shop Pro takes 4,5,6 minuets in a large file (28 meg). In Photoshop (even LE), the filter runs in less than a minute.Then there is PageMaker. This is the only way to do lay out. Working in layers, it is even possible to print your file as ""text only"" for proofing. Linked images work flawlessly. The commands and tools are simple and intuitive. Ventura is a nightmare by comparison....don't try it one without a manual. PageMaker also writes clean HTML and PDF files that may be all you need.Still, Acrobat works tightly with MS-Word, Excel, etc. It even installs itself on the Word toolbar, ready to dump your Word Doc into a PDF file. I write my own HTML, converting lots of long doccuments. Often, an Acrobat file is just as efficient, preserves layout, and gives ultimate control. I have the feeling I might be writting less and less HTML code.Illustrator? I have limited experience here, but am told my someone I trust that its capabilities are at least as great as Draw, and Draw is good.....this one, I am told, may be too close to call, but we are talking a ""collection"" here, with four great programs made greater by their collective strength.Finally, the Publishing Collection is the real deal from Adobe. $600.00 for PhotoShop, $500.00 for PageMaker, $250.00 for Acrobat, $400.00 for Illustrator. Or-----buy the Publishing Collection and get them all for $999.00 or there abouts.

Of course, if it doesn't come in December, I won't be able to get a rough estimate of taxes before years end - in time to do something about it.I really felt that if the company knows of a problem (like the Quicken one last summer), they should post the workaround on the web until the update is ready.

At the beginning it leaked a bit, but after that (I really don't know why) it was ok. It is pretty comfortable. The built-in pump works very good and very convenient in use. The only two things are that I don't like in this matress are that one side of this matress is higher by 2-3 mm than another. And when you sleep on it you feel like there is a small angle. I mean the matress is not 100% horizontal. Another thing that peaces me off is the noise that comes from the matress when you move or somehow turn over.

I bought mine at [a physical store] becuase Amazon.com didn't have any in stock but it has 22x optical zoom, and 880 digital zoom which is amazing!! The main reason I bought this camera is beacuse I will be goin to Italy for this summer and also Tunisia and I needed a camcorder, (It is my first one). It has a PAL system built in which means that you can basically use it anywhere in the world. The visuals are great and it has digital effects such as, black and white, fade, black light, mirror, sepia, negative picture, art, mosaic, 16:9, and cinema. Maybe the only bad thing is that it doesn't have an image stabilizer but it doesn't really bother me beacuse the other Samsung that does costs about [much more]. I would reccomend getting a Camcorder bag and an extra Lithium-Ion battery if your going to use it alot. It has two features that one is, EASY which everything advanced is turned off, more for begginers, and then a CUSTOM setting where you can customize everything the way you want it. It comes with the AC Adapter and the cable, a Lithium-Ion battery, hand strap, shoulder strap, lens cover, and AV cables which work great! Another great thing about it is that it is very small and it has a light you can turn on that helps just as good as if you were in a pitch black room and you couldn't see and you turned on a flash light.

It wants to do everying, like organizing your files within its system of doing things. My files are already organized, thank you. So I just use the simple Microsoft Office Document Scanner software that I already know how to use. It's fully compatable with the scanner and I can convert to PDF without a problem. I can fax scanned documents as easy as pie.In looking over the negative reviews here, it seems like many of them had problems with the set up and didn't get much help from Xerox support. i.e, an axe to grind? Don't let them scare you away. The instructions are explicit on how to do the set up. It's not a simple plug and play type of unit.

Inflating it was quick and easy since it has a built-in pump: you plug it in, turn it on and switch off when it's inflated enough for you. The only drawback is that the pump is really noisy - about the same as a loud vacuum cleaner - so you probably want to inflate the mattress before the rest of the household goes to bed.I had one guest a week, two weeks in a row, sleeping on it for several nights. Both found it comfortable and slept well on it. The extra height makes it feel more like a regular bed and less like you're camping out on someone's floor.Like all air mattresses, the air sucks heat from the body so the sleeper can get really cold; I've found the best way around this is to place a blanket or comforter on the mattress before you put the sheets on - this bottom blanket will insulate the person from the cold air.So far it's been great and I have no complaints.",electronics

The case annoyingly, covers up the face and power jacks. The power jack isn't a big deal, but the face is.

The included case fans are noisy at 12v, but can be made to run on 5v or 7v with little noise.I use mine as a Bedroom Media PC whose primary purpose is being a TV set/recorder. With a Pentium M based system and a very quiet Seasonic PSU (S12-330) there is no need for the noisy case fans to be turned on. As a result, this system is virtually silent and cannot be heard from across the room.

B0000DFZ67,0/0,4.0,"I personally like the control that the Zen Xtra gives you in organizing and classifying your music. It also creates playlists on the go for you (combining tracks by the same Artist, the same album, or same genre) for easy playback retrieval.The software that it comes with, Creative MediaSource, is great also, however may be a little complicated for new computer users. It lets you edit all track information (Artist, genre, album, track #) regardless of what ID3 tags were used when recording.Also do I need to remind you of the removable battery. Poor iPod users have to shell out almost $100 to get their battery serviced/replaced when its dead. Also you can store, data files, video files, etc. on the Zen Xtra (it's a portable hard drive also)The only negative is the buttons on the case are oddly positioned.Overall I don't recommend this item for newbies.

The sound is excellent, the battery life is excellent, the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent, and finally the price, $200 cheaper than the 40gb Ipod, is excellent. The only thing the Ipod has over the Nomad is the style, size, and ease of use. The Nomad is not ugly, it is not that big, it comfortably fits in my pocet, or heavy, and the controls are not hard to get used to. So far I have no complaints and I recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance, also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing. I only have one question, when I add tracks to my Nomad, via Nomad Explorer, they are automatically put in alphebetical order, rather than album order. Is this possible to fix, if so how, if not does Notmad Explorer from Red Chair Software do this? I would like album order for my live albums and was just wondering. Thank you very much, and go out and get yourself a Nomad!",electronics

B0000DFZ67,3/3,5.0,"Yeah, the Zen is awesome. I debated back and forth for about three months over buying the Zen and the iPod. Eventually, I decided on the Zen. Why? Mainly for the issue of the battery of the iPod. From what I understand, the iPod's battery dies and will not hold a charge after about 18 months. And, when it dies, Apple replaces if for $100 and doesn't even send back your original iPod - so all the music which you put on it is lost. This does not seem to be the case with the Zen. However, now that Creative has (or is coming out with) a 40 GB version of the Zen touch model, that might be a better purchase, simply because the battery seems to last much longer. I can get the Zen's batter to last for about 9 hours on 20% contrast and a 5 second backlight, while still skipping tracks frequently.Also, the headphone jack problem has been mentioned in some of the previous reviews. From what I understand, that problem was an earlier model of the Zen and Creative has fixed the headphone jack. I certainly have not had any problems with mine. Definitely a good buy!",electronics

B000MQJ19S,29/29,5.0,"I am not sure why everyone has given this player a bad review. I own the 8 GB version, and I love it. I have never been impressed with the iPod. It's too over-rated, and it's not appealing to me. Although the click-wheel is cool, that's all that I like.I also looked into the Zune, and I'm not impressed with that one either. I checked out the 30 and 80 GB versions of the Zune. The 30 GB is like a brick. It's huge! And it's heavy. And I don't really need 80 GB of space.Then one day, strolling through Best Buy (or rather, Worst Buy) I came upon the SanDisk Sansa View. I started playing with the features on the in-store display, and I was impressed. First off, SanDisk has been around for years and is a name that geeks everywhere (like me) know and trust. Second, it's not an iPod. Third, it does all of the same things as the iPod, and it's cheaper. Let's compare.....The 4 GB iPod Nano (3rd. Gen.) is $149.99. It plays music, video, displays pictures, has a click-wheel, and is kinda small.The 8 GB SanDisk Sansa View is $149.99. It plays music, video, displays pictures, and has an FM tuner. It can also record through a microphone, and it has a click-wheel type device on the front for navigation through menus.My favorite feature that blows the iPod and the Zune out of the window is that the Sansa View is expandable. You can put in up to 4 GB more via MicroSD or SDHC. I've never seen an iPod do that!So, overall, I am in love with this iPod and Zune killer. I hope more people out there will realize that the big names like iPod and Zune are just getting money for a name, where as the other companies like SanDisk give quality products for the price of the big name stuff.Oh, and one last thing. Windows Media Player is the only downside. I'm not a fan of the Windows Media Player, but it the sync process easy and fast. I put 4 GB of music on my player all at once, and it only took about 4 minutes. Not too bad.Not-as-popular companies: 1 Big name companies: 0",electronics

B0000DFZ67,0/0,5.0,"I actually purchased this player at Comp USA, which is, as far as I know, no longer in business. Well, at least in hampton roads. I loved Comp USA, because like Circuit city or Best Buy, if you had a problem with a product, you could return it no questions asked. This is an incredibly well built player. The con is that creative labs only usually ships the software with their products and they can't be used with anything else besides Windows Media Player. Although now, you can't anyway since Microsoft licenses their Vista software to only cooperate with windows products....ie Zune. I still own this player, my second, since my first one I accidentally dropped while jogging and busted the hard drive. The salesperson tried to sell me over to the Ipod but I stuck with this one. To this day, I feel it is a great MP3 player. However, it will eventually give up and no product will replace it since Creative does not have anything on the market currently to compete with the heavyweights Microsoft and Apple. What a shame too, since Creative at 2004 was a major competitor. Now I feel like advertizing has pushed Creative Labs out of the ring of competition and eventually will die as a result. I do own a 80GB Zune, although that player sadly cannot match the quality of this one. Sure, it doesn't have a color screen, the abiltity to play movies, homemade videos, pictures or anything like that, but it's durable. Hardly anything I've seen or heard today has any longetivity to it. I wish companies would stop saying we're better than you and just go back to making high quality products like they did with Cassette Players.",electronics

B000GQB4QW,9/9,5.0,"I have owned this TV for almost three months now and I am still wowed by its fantastic image. I am quite picky about my electronics and this is the third HDTV I've had in my home. I've returned both a Samsung 50"" DLP and a competitor's 42"" LCD. Honestly, before I bought this model, I was scared I'd never find a TV that lived up to my quality standards. I took a gamble on this Samsung when I saw its price had dropped. Am I happy I made that purchase now!I'm an avid gamer, so response time and lag-free scan conversion were high on my list of wants. Quite simply, Gears of War looks unbelievable at 720p. I was hesitant of upgrading to HD because of concerns over losing the ability to play older games. You will want to make sure your consoles can output over component video (even 480i is fine, of course) or that you have some means of up-converting older inputs (my Sony stereo does a pretty poor job of this). But since the PS2 can render PS1 games (Final Fantasy IX never looked so good) and the Wii supports progressive scan GameCube games (mmm, Super Smash Bros. Melee at 480p) this has ceased to be a problem.I won't say that standard definition video looks good. I've heard that this TV is rated the highest among 32"" TVs for SD video, but who buys an HDTV for SD television channels? I will say that 24 looks better in 1080i than my DVDs look at 480p. Watch the opening to House and you will become a believer. I also can't speak to this TV's 10W speakers. If you have the funds for this LCD TV, you already have a nice receiver and surround sound (or top-end two-channel speakers). I haven't had audio running to my TV in years. This Samsung does have a nice option for a hardware mute, so my TV speakers have never even been used. But I don't know, maybe this is a bedroom TV for you; it's not like any of its competitors have seriously better offerings for audio either.So, yes, this 32"" LCD has a price that competes with some 40"" LCDs. But for good reason; this is the best of the best when it comes to 32"" TVs. And any 40"" below $1500 isn't worth your money. I'm a hard sell and I have fallen in love with this TV and would recommend it without hesitation. Great job, Samsung.",electronics
B0000DFZ6A,45/46,2.0,"Have owned 4 flatbed scanners up til now, 3 of which were visioneers. I use these scanners for archiving books and magazines. The 7300 good features: small, slim design. Easy to use for scanning books and magazines. USB powered. THE BAD:I scan all my images at 300 dpi and 8.5 x 11 inches. The 7300 took over 60 seconds to scan a color page (grayscale is about 25 seconds). In contrast, my previous scanner, a visioneer 9320, did a color page in 25 seconds. Also, it saves everything in .max format (in its paperport software), a format only paperport can use. You can convert it into jpeg format but that is just an extra step to do. I use adobe elements to edit the scan and it doesn't recognize the .max format so every scan has to be converted. So I sit a press the enter key = to the number of scans I made. It's operation was quiet except for an annoying squeaking and popping sounds it randomly made. I literally scan thousands of pages every week so speed is important. MY RECOMMENDATION: I have owned a visoneer 9320, 7300, a HP 2400 scanner and a visoneer 7100. The best one is the visioneer 7100 -- Has decent scanning speed, color or grayscale and the scans can be made in bmp format instead of the paperport max format. Adobe elements can open bmp format and when I use elements to convert to jpeg, the pictures, in my opinion, are better looking. All scanners wear out at 25,000 to 30,000 scans (the glass ""wears out"" with minute scratches on its surface and effects the scan) so if you scan alot of pages, like me, the $50-60 cost of the 7100 is easy on the wallet.",electronics

B000HDFH6W,0/0,5.0,"I like the idea of a grey card that travels in any of my carrying options; Pelican case, shoulder bag, knapsack or around the neck using the lanyard.I shoot with a Canon 7D, and I use these cards at the start of a shoot by taking an exposure of the white card or grey card so that the card is reflecting the same light as my subject. In order to get the optimal result, I switch the auto focus off, and try to fill the frame with the card, so that the resultant exposure is mostly the white or grey card only, while still reflecting the light I'll be shooting in.Next, I use the menu tab to go to the second camera settings tab (second red tab from the left), and use the scroll wheel to drop down to the fourth choice, which is ""Custom WB"". Select this choice, and using the shot you just took of the white or grey card, select the option ""use WB data from this image for Custom WB"". You'll get the custom white balance icon as you hit the ""set"" button. Once you've done this, select the white balance option and select the custom WB icon. Now, your shots will use the white balance based on the white card you've shot using the same reflected light that you intend to use for your shots. Repeat the process as the light changes. I generally take a quick few test exposures, and see how the custom white balance effect compares to the Auto WB or the other WB settings (such as sunlight, cloudy, etc) and almost always find the custom white balance to be more accurate.By carrying the cards around my neck on the lanyard, I look like a photo-geek but I have the color cards handy, to re-set the custom balance as the light changes.You can also do the method of shooting the cards at the beginning of a sequence, and using the exposure of the cards in Photo Shop to use the eyedropper tool to set white balance. However, I prefer to make changes as the light changes for truer white balance. Having the cards on the lanyard means that this option is always at hand.Nice product, cards can be used, abused and cleaned, and being on the lanyard, they're always handy to tweak your white balance as the light changes throughout your shoot. I find this to be more accurate than shooting a mess of pictures throughout the day in a variety of lighting conditions, and trying to force-fit all the white balance at the end of the day with the eyedropper tool in PS. I may be wrong in this, but so far I prefer to use the cards in this manner.",electronics

They too advised that the repairs would be EXTREMELY expensive.I took both units to to the Pioneer warehouse/repair center in Dominguez Hills, California where they gave me the bad news. NO, the drives can not simply be replaced. If I wanted Pioneer to replace the drives (or 'activate' my known good drives in any unit) the cost is a whopping $250 per hour each plus any possible parts.

B000063W8Q,3/3,5.0,"For it's price, which i in the mid-consumer range, and well below the pro range, it's a very nice little tripod.The legs lock firmly and are easy to latch and unlatch, the leg brace is at the bottom of the first set of leg tubes, which puts it off the ground even at the lowest height, overall manufacturing quality is very good--including the carrying case which is tough enough to last a while, unlike most such bags included with consumer equipment. It's a mid-weight nylon canvas with a self-repairing plastic zipper.I'm shooting with a moderately heavy camera (VX1000) at 4+# additions for a total weight of around 6-7#It is a LIGHT tripod. With the tripod fully extended it has a tendency to wobble a bit under the weight of my gear. Weighting this one in windy conditions or when shooting fully extended (especially with telephoto,) is a necessity.As others have noted, the zoom control moves the reverse of most camera zooms which is a pain to get used to, but can be gotten used too. (Hey LANC controls generally cost more than this tripod with it's controls!) If it continues to bother me, I may disassemble and reverse the control.With a lighter 1-2# consumer camera it is a VERY nice tripod, with less weight on top it is extremely stable.The carrying bag is very nice bonus. It's deigned to slip over your head and arm and run across your back--I'm 6'4"" and have no trouble with it binding, and it is light enough to be barely noticeable. Very nice if you're traveling.As a consumer tripod its an excellent choice esp. if you are shooting with one of the newer small cameras, The LANC control helps stop a lot of camera wiggle and makes for smooth combination pan/tilt /zoom operations.The fluid head is of very good quality for the price, and has a nice range of adjustable drag.For heavier gear it needs added bottom weights outside, but works pretty well indoors.Besides the backwards zoom my only trouble has been that I accidentally hit the on/off button a lot--but that's mostly due to my height which tends to make me grip the handle in a choke grip.The LANC control should also be improved had they made the I/O a standard LANC plug rather than the molded relief permanent cable--it's too easy to forget to disconnect the cable when removing the gear, and I have some concerns about the longevity of that built in cable.THe LANC control handle is removable which opens up the possibility of using it from some distance away from the camera (I have a 20' LANC extension cable for use when the camera is mounted outside a vehicleI've shot about 7 hours of a documentary with it to date, and it has performed very well.I recommend it for consumer lightweights and reservedly recommend it for heavier prosumer cameras.

The biggest problem I have is that the battery only lasts for about 3.5 hours playing music before it is discharged vs. 18+ hours for my e200. I'm not sure what the problem is but it simply wont last.A quick update, i contacted sandisk about the poor battery life. After formating and a hard reset, the player completely lost its mind and I am instructed toreturn it as it is defective.A further update, I've learned a few things about this player from use groups. first the June firmware update fixes the battery life issue. It lasts at least 9 hours and looked like it was 1/2 depleted.It does not work particularly well with Rhapsody unlike SanDisks other players. If you have rhapsody to go and load a to go play list (ie rented music with WMA extension) their are several oddities that you have to put up with. First, whatever you do do not auto-update any play lists. The playlists will get corrupted and strange songs get inserted and others deleted with no rhyme or reason. If this happens, the only thing you can do is to format the player in both modes and then reload all your music. The same corruption often occurs if you try to update a playlist with WMA files. When this happens the only thing you can do is format the player in both modes and reload all music. This takes about an hour which is a real pain. This does not occur with MP3 files.Other then the file weirdities it is a pretty good player, but the file thing bugs the heck out of me. Rhapsody and SanDisk point fingers at each other but it just flat doesnt work well in the music rental mode. Other then that a pretty darn good player for the money",electronics

B0000DFZ67,7/7,5.0,"This is my second MP3 player. I am very pleased the Zen player. I have the 30 GB model and approximately 7500 songs loaded up. The random mode is outstanding. I rarely hear duplicate tracks. The sound quality (as expected from Creative) is top notch. I don't bother to use EAX in fact the quality is so high. I have read that the battery life is shortened by the use of EAX, which only makes sense. I am able to go about 14 hours in between charges. I had to be creative (huh huh huh) to get the included case to work but that is a small compromise. Right now the 40 GB models are going for under $200. You just can't beat that value. I bought myself, and wife both 30 GB Zen models for less than the price of 1 20 GB Ipod. The creative software is flexible and fast. I had to use windows media player with my previous MP3 player which was slower than molasses in January when it came to looking up and erasing tracks that were currently on the player. I would rather have a little larger player and get the battery life that goes hand in hand. Let's face it, the bottom line is, these players have to have 1. A hard drive 2. Some type of processor/memory combination to process the info from the hard drive and turn it into music, and 3. A battery. There is not too much variation in items 1 or 2. The only area that can be cut to make the unit smaller is in the battery. Ipod may be smaller, but I can go over twice as long in between changes. The bottom line is I am thrilled with this player. If I were to somehow drop the player from a moving vehicle, or have a pack of wild pixies make of with my player in the middle of the night, I would not hesitate to order another one immediately. My search is done, yours can be too. You can't go wrong with the Creative player, but I would recommend spending the $10-$15 difference to upgrade to the 40 GB version. 10,000 songs in a package that is smaller than a portable cassette player that will go for 14 hours in between charges.....

B0000DFZ67,7/8,4.0,"I've had my Zen Xtra 40Gb for just over a year now. Up until now I have never had an issue with it. A lot of complaints that have been sent the Zen's way seem to have been a result of either ignorance or negligence.Complaint 1: The sound quality is average...Well it depends on what you call good quality sound. If you are from Europe and your idea of good sound is cranking up the music higher than anyone else in the area, then perhaps - if you did not upgrade your firmware with the US firmware (which does not have a volume limiter)- you are incorrect. I am a musician(trained to hear good sound) and with a good set of headphones/earphones, the Jukebox is out there beating the competition. Do yourself a favour and upgrade your firmware. You'll notice an immediate difference in the way it plays.Complaint 2: The Control Buttons are inconvenient in comparison to the iPodI couldn't disagree more heartily. I did a comparison with my father's iPod and immediately realised that navigating the iPod blindly while carrying it on the belt would be a very difficult task indeed. Instead, the Zen's side controls allow for blind navigation as each button serves as an individual function button. Perfect for rush hour on the tube when you want your player out of sight, but accessible...Complaint 3: The iPod has more features.Perhaps. Although I don't know if the iPod's playback menu items are near as comprehensive as the Zen's. For example: on the Zen it is possible to search for: a track, an artist, an album or a genre. Something the iPod doesn't seem to be able to do.Complaint 4: The Zen is flimsy.As with any portable device, the first thing you should do for it is get a case. Mine has never left its case except for the odd clean here and there. The case is tight-fitting, robust and has a belt-clip. Abuse or neglect any computer and it will give you hassles...This machine is tough, its good-looking (although not as good looking as the iPod), has awesome sound with a feature rich interface (there's always a pleasant surprise in the form of a menu-shortcut or an added feature springing up somewhere) and after 4639 songs, it still has 16Gb of free space. Nothing wrong with that!My only complaint is with regards to Creative's software. Now Creative make damn good hardware, but their software sucks to be honest with you. I am quite savvy when it comes to computer related stuff, but Creative's Media Source software is just aweful and buggy and so damn ugly. I eventually went across to Red Chair and bought their Notmad software which really does bring out the potential of the Zen and even adds some enhancements such as faster transfer of songs between the Zen and PC, streaming music from the player to the PC etc, etc... Do yourself a favour and don't even bother opening up Creative's solution!For the sake of their software alone, I am dropping a star off my rating. I would give the hardware a 10 out of 5 and the software a minus 6 leaving us with four stars. Thats fair I think. :)In conclusion, I think this is the best, most complete MP3 player on the market(despite all the new competition!!)",electronics

B000063W93,29/30,5.0,"I love this camcorder. First of all, I am going to start this review by telling you about the biggest concern I had when I bought this camera. Many people say that there was a lot of motor hum, this may be the case when the room is TOTALLY silent, however an external mic fixes this. ALL MINIDV CAMERAS HAVE THIS PROBLEM!! People complain that the mic adds extra size, but if you want to spend the same amount of money on a digital 8, with less resolution, much bigger, and heavier, than get a Mic for your MiniDV, then you have some problems. However since I usually overlap music onto my videos, its not such a big probelm for me. The size is great (any bigger and it wouldn't be comfortable, and any smaller it would be difficult to hold). I had the Sony TRV-340 Digital 8 Camera and then returned for only one reason, it was heavy and big (it cut off circulation in my hand when I was filming, and would have to take it out every 5 minutes or it would become numb). The picture quality is pretty much the same as all other minidv's which are better than digital 8's but not enough to make a big difference. Pretty much, this is a good camera at a great price. If you want a MiniDV, go with this no doubt, however if you have hi 8 or 8mm tapes you should probably go with a digital 8. They are pretty good for the price, but big and bulky.",electronics
B000063W94,0/0,5.0,"After 4 years of heavy use, our trusty b&w; HP laser printer died and we decided to go for a color printer. Since we recently got a digital camera, photo quality was a must. After much research, we considered buying a Canon, but went to a store to see if we could get any info about photo printing in general. A young man advised us to go for an HP, showing us pictures he'd taken and printed, and explaining some other points. We did some further research and the main complaint against the 940c was its' tendency to eat paper.We've had this printer for 3 weeks, and it did eat paper and printed unevenly until we discovered that a small door on the back, used to clear paper jams, was not fully closed. Going to HP's website, we learned that the paper guides must be snug and that it works best with stacks of photo paper, rather than 1-2 sheets of photo paper placed on a previous stack of plain paper. We have not had problems with paper feeds since.Overall, this printer is a fantastic value and provides the best bang for the buck you can get. The photo quality is indistinguishable from a 'real' photo. This, however, is dependent on the quality of the photo, as well as the paper used (we have had excellent results with HP's Premium Glossy paper). If the focus of the picture is slightly off, the print will look awful. The photos will look only as good as the original pictures. The plain paper text printing is surprisingly good as well, even in draft mode. Also, the print heads are part of the ink cartridges. This means that they are replaced when you replace cartridges and require no cleaning and less maintenance. As we've discoverd, replacing print heads can be expensive.Pros:* True photo quality* Excellent plain paper text printing* Non-photo printing is fast* Separate color & black ink cartridges* Printing heads are part of ink cartridgesCons:* Photo printing is not that fast, but the quality is worth it* A little bulky, but all inkjets are like that*UPDATE April 2003*Amazing - it still works like new! However, we we have covered our printer since day one as we have cats and wanted to keep the printer cat hair-free. This has also kept our printer dust-free, and we think it has made a difference. This printer has easily been amongst the best buys we have ever made.",electronics

B0000DFZ6A,45/46,2.0,"Have owned 4 flatbed scanners up til now, 3 of which were visioneers. I use these scanners for archiving books and magazines. The 7300 good features: small, slim design. Easy to use for scanning books and magazines. USB powered. THE BAD:I scan all my images at 300 dpi and 8.5 x 11 inches. The 7300 took over 60 seconds to scan a color page (grayscale is about 25 seconds). In contrast, my previous scanner, a visioneer 9320, did a color page in 25 seconds. Also, it saves everything in .max format (in its paperport software), a format only paperport can use. You can convert it into jpeg format but that is just an extra step to do. I use adobe elements to edit the scan and it doesn't recognize the .max format so every scan has to be converted. So I sit a press the enter key = to the number of scans I made. It's operation was quiet except for an annoying squeaking and popping sounds it randomly made. I literally scan thousands of pages every week so speed is important. MY RECOMMENDATION: I have owned a visoneer 9320, 7300, a HP 2400 scanner and a visoneer 7100. The best one is the visioneer 7100 -- Has decent scanning speed, color or grayscale and the scans can be made in bmp format instead of the paperport max format. Adobe elements can open bmp format and when I use elements to convert to jpeg, the pictures, in my opinion, are better looking. All scanners wear out at 25,000 to 30,000 scans (the glass ""wears out"" with minute scratches on its surface and effects the scan) so if you scan alot of pages, like me, the $50-60 cost of the 7100 is easy on the wallet.",electronics

It's a mid-weight nylon canvas with a self-repairing plastic zipper.I'm shooting with a moderately heavy camera (VX1000) at 4+# additions for a total weight of around 6-7#It is a LIGHT tripod. With the tripod fully extended it has a tendency to wobble a bit under the weight of my gear. Weighting this one in windy conditions or when shooting fully extended (especially with telephoto,) is a necessity.As others have noted, the zoom control moves the reverse of most camera zooms which is a pain to get used to, but can be gotten used too. (Hey LANC controls generally cost more than this tripod with it's controls!) If it continues to bother me, I may disassemble and reverse the control.With a lighter 1-2# consumer camera it is a VERY nice tripod, with less weight on top it is extremely stable.The carrying bag is very nice bonus. It's deigned to slip over your head and arm and run across your back--I'm 6'4"" and have no trouble with it binding, and it is light enough to be barely noticeable. Very nice if you're traveling.As a consumer tripod its an excellent choice esp. if you are shooting with one of the newer small cameras, The LANC control helps stop a lot of camera wiggle and makes for smooth combination pan/tilt /zoom operations.The fluid head is of very good quality for the price, and has a nice range of adjustable drag.For heavier gear it needs added bottom weights outside, but works pretty well indoors.Besides the backwards zoom my only trouble has been that I accidentally hit the on/off button a lot--but that's mostly due to my height which tends to make me grip the handle in a choke grip.The LANC control should also be improved had they made the I/O a standard LANC plug rather than the molded relief permanent cable--it's too easy to forget to disconnect the cable when removing the gear, and I have some concerns about the longevity of that built in cable.THe LANC control handle is removable which opens up the possibility of using it from some distance away from the camera (I have a 20' LANC extension cable for use when the camera is mounted outside a vehicleI've shot about 7 hours of a documentary with it to date, and it has performed very well.I recommend it for consumer lightweights and reservedly recommend it for heavier prosumer cameras.

The cable was perfect for watching movies on my TV without disrupting others, as well as for late night gaming sessions.CONS:After about 1 year of average use (about 3-4 times a week for about 2-3 hours each time used), the cord fails to deliver sound to one ear. I tried multiple headsets/earphones, but the same side will not receive sound when used with the extension. After very carefully halfway inserting the headphone jack into the female end of this extension cable, sound delivers in both ears. Only after doing that was I able to get sound on both ears. Even then, sound quality was noticeably diminished.CONCLUSION:If you're not going to be moving the cable around much or inserting/removing headphones from the jacks frequently, then I suggest you get these. Otherwise, I'd advise you get an extension cable with a sturdier build. I think my problem may have been caused by inserting/re-inserting headphone jacks into the female end of the cable. I should add that I take pretty well care of my belongings, so I don't think I'm at fault for the damage.SIDENOTE:I purchased two 6-foot Belkin audio extension cables from Newegg to replace my damaged extension cable.

In fact, everyone who saw it thought I was &quot;The Man&quot; and won't believe I returned it.So what's the problem?================I made the mistake of thinking I could easily manage my mp3 library with this device. I initially loaded about 3700 tracks with the intent of ripping the majority of my remaining CDs to mp3. I quickly discovered that the Nomad wasn't going to work for me. The reasons below will be true for ANY product in this category.Here's why:========1. I don't need the Nomad at the office. I have my mp3's stored on my workstation.2. I don't need the Nomad at home for the same reason (although using it to sync between the two PC's might be a reason enough to get it.)3. It's a hazard in the car. The navigation is nice enough, but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks, hundreds of albums or artists, or even dozens of genres is not conducive to save driving. (Throw a cell phone and you're asking for trouble.)3a. Creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 wasn't as easy as I would have liked.The bottom line:===========If I have to get into making playlists to avoid rear-end collisions, I'll just buy a regular portable CD/MP3 player and burn myself collections of about 120 tracks per disk. Sure it's &quot;old school&quot; to carry a CD wallet around, but it will be easier to manage and I'll save around 250 bucks.One major complaint:==============My only significant complaint is sound quality. The EAX sound enhancement feature didn't do enough for me and the custom EQ was a limited 5 band EQ. This did not give me enough control. I wanted to use the Nomad with a cassette style car adapter. I was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable CD player with &quot;bass boost.&quot; The sound quality of my CD player is superior in this setting to the Nomad.One minor complaint:==============The documentation says to extend battery life, do not fill player to capacity.

Within six months of purchase, both power supplies to my indoor cameras failed. Replaced.In June, 2008, one of my outdoor cameras died. I contacted customer serviced and gave the information. Three days later, I got an email from Lukwerks tech. support with an RMA number. I packaged the dead camera and sent it in. About 10 days later, I received a replacement. In all, I was without the camera for about two weeks, but I DID get it replaced.In July, 2008 my second outdoor camera failed. I have not yet had it replaced. I purchased it in June, 2007, so it'll be interesting to see if they will replace it since the warranty is only 1 year.

I speculate that it is caused by electrical noise or surges that are frying the fragile components in the cameras. During the summer these are fluctuations in electrical power caused by all of the air conditions and the switching going on by the power company. Since you cannot put line conditioners or surge protection on the cameras, they are fully open to this noise. It's either that or just the heat of the summer. Either way, the components in the cameras seem very weak and fragile. To have a 100% of my outdoor cameras fail within 14 months is disturbing.When the cameras work, they do an adequate job.

B000063W93,29/30,5.0,"I love this camcorder. First of all, I am going to start this review by telling you about the biggest concern I had when I bought this camera. Many people say that there was a lot of motor hum, this may be the case when the room is TOTALLY silent, however an external mic fixes this. ALL MINIDV CAMERAS HAVE THIS PROBLEM!! People complain that the mic adds extra size, but if you want to spend the same amount of money on a digital 8, with less resolution, much bigger, and heavier, than get a Mic for your MiniDV, then you have some problems. However since I usually overlap music onto my videos, its not such a big probelm for me. The size is great (any bigger and it wouldn't be comfortable, and any smaller it would be difficult to hold). I had the Sony TRV-340 Digital 8 Camera and then returned for only one reason, it was heavy and big (it cut off circulation in my hand when I was filming, and would have to take it out every 5 minutes or it would become numb). The picture quality is pretty much the same as all other minidv's which are better than digital 8's but not enough to make a big difference. Pretty much, this is a good camera at a great price. If you want a MiniDV, go with this no doubt, however if you have hi 8 or 8mm tapes you should probably go with a digital 8. They are pretty good for the price, but big and bulky.",electronics

This device has been the best investment dollar-for-dollar that I can ever remember making. If you are a pharma rep and your company privides you with an IPAQ, be careful. The program that your company uses takes up a lot of memory. It works OK on mine, but I find that I need to reboot it once in a while. This is a very small price to pay, for what this does. In short, this unit is for computer savvy people, who want a GPS. I wouldn't go out and buy grandma a new IPAQ and this device. For non-computer folks, consider the Magellan for the ease of use and userfriendliness.Note: Although great in its day, this device is now way out of date.

B000MQJ19S,5/5,2.0,"I bought this unit recently as i wanted a personal media player with good facilities and a large storage capacity (I bought the 8GB model). The unit looks lovely, has a very nice user interface, and excellent sound and picture quality.I bought an 8GB micro SD HC card to increase the total storage to 16GB.Here's the catch. The firmware in the unit is buggy; this makes the player unreliable and very annoying to use.After doing a full charge (12 hours), I loaded up the player from WMP11 in MTP sync mode - this requires you to sync to 2 separate devices: internal memory and external card. Once I had completed the upload, which took several hours, I removed the USB cable and the player rebooted.Ever since then, it has intermittently refused to power up. Sometimes when you switch it on, after displaying the Sansa splash screen for a few seconds, it simply switches itself off, freezes or crashes. On other occasions it gets stuck, saying 'refreshing database'. This occurs about 50% of the time, even after a full charge cycle. It seems to be worse if you have left it switched off for over 24 hours.I downloaded the Sansa firmware updater and installed the latest firmware update (01.03.02A) but this has not fixed the problem. I have to say I am frustrated by these bugs which spoil an otherwise fine product. I am consequently returning this product to Amazon, and will continue to look elsewhere for a personal media player.",electronics

I've had an Epson Photostylus 870 for the past couple of years and had a little ink mis-hap (my fault) and thought, what the heck I'll get a new printer figuring the technology has improved, etc. This time I decided to go with an HP because I generally like their products, but I'm going back to an Epson.The quality of photo prints are not even comparable. The Epson prints are clear, crisp and realistic. The HP prints (even at 2400dpi) are grainy and fuzzy.Not to mention that ever since I installed the printer (using USB) my floppy disk drive has been grinding every few minutes. Not sure what's up with that.I will say that the HP is fast and fairly quiet. Printing regular documents on paper of course looks nice, but for ""real"" photo images try Epson.Good luck!",electronics

And I lose on the return shipping everytime !Before purchasing, reviewing the manual makes a BIG difference to the buyer to know how this device is manipulated. I had reviewed many similar products to come to the conclusion that when multi-function devices like these are made, the critical functions are given a back-seat...for example, voice recording..for those who buy this product for memo recording, if we have to press a number of buttons to get to what we want, it defeats the purpose of having this feature at all.Amazon's awesome feature of looking at the product manual really helps us decide on a purchase.

Boy was I in for a surprise. Not only did this player fulfill my expectations, it made me a believer in SanDisk products.Since I listen to the radio a lot, I really appreciate the built in radio; which by the way, works great. The only time you'll have a reduction in sound quality is when you are in an elevator, or in an underground parking lot. Otherwise, the sound is as good as a car radio when you are out in the open.You won't be able to use itunes with this unit. You have to use Windows Media Player. WMP may seem a little confusing at first, so just make sure you have the latest version of the player, and you should be OK.One reviewer complained about not being able to charge the player through his PC. SanDisk mentions that not all PC's will be able to charge the player when the computer is OFF; but it will always charge with no problem when the PC is ON. Keep that in mind. If you don't want to always have the PC on to charge the player, then get the Belkin charging kit.

The futon was the most uncomfortable thing I have ever sat on, let alone try to sleep on. I doubt Target will take it back, without a box. So I got a cheap Coleman air mattress to use on top of the futon at night. That way I figure I can still have a ""couch"" during the day.

The repair patch was useless, so I decided to find a new air mattress online.The price for this one was perfect, and the reviews were possitive so I took a chance.

Also, the repair patch included is way better then the cheap little sticker included in my original Coleman air bed, although I hope to never have need of it.At first I was concerned with the height, being taller the my old one was, but I decided to take a chance and order it anyway. Actually on top of the futon, it is the same height as a regular mattress and boxspring, so I lucked out on that as well.I'm definately going to order a queen size for my bf and I to use for camping and Burning Man.

I'm very happy with this purchase.There is a rotating control for the air pressure in the mattress once you have inflated it that allows you to adjust it to the level of comfort that suits you. It can also be used to let the air out to deflate the mattress completely, should you no longer be near an electric outlet. The supplied cord tucks neatly out of the way into a compartment at the head of the mattress and is easily accessed.Cons: I don't really consider these to be &#34;cons&#34;, but may make a difference to some:1) There is a rubber odor that can be bothersome to some who have migraines caused by strong scents. Or, to people that just don't like strong odors. You will definitely smell it when you first use it. I have only used this a couple of times, and I did inflate it and allowed it to air out some in an attempt to curb it. I haven't had it long enough to see if it wears off eventually, but I will update if it does. I use it really only once a week. I think I'm used to it as it didn't keep me awake when I slept on it.2) It's a little loud, ok more than a little when inflating it and deflating it using the motor. Not overly, but if you have to use it for yourself/guests, and you need to be quiet, then inflate it ahead of time when it won't disturb others because it will wake the house up. Think &#34;noisy vacuum cleaner&#34; to give you an idea of what I mean by loud. That's probably accurate.Other than that - I highly recommend it! Enjoy!",electronics

Its taken more than its fair share of bumps and bruises and has never skipped a beat. While many of the guys here have opted for MP3/CD players, they are constantly cleaning the lenses and the moving parts often get fouled with sand and dust. The Zen Xtra is a sealed unit with no moving parts other than the rocker wheel on the side.

It has a Cancel Printing button on the printer console that does indeed immediately abort the current printing job, a very nice feature. It has an ink level display that can be viewed onscreen in the HP software as well as ink level warning lights on the console. Envelopes are not wrinkled running through the printer (a problem with some older HPs). There is also a convenient single envelope slot for printing just one envelope without removing the regular-sized paper from the tray, for which the loading capacity is 150 sheets. In my experience, HP printheads need much less time- and ink-wasting maintenance and fussy handholding than the clog-prone printhead on the 1998 Epson inkjet I just replaced. I can&#8217;t tell yet how long the ink cartridges last; I&#8217;ll try to post an update when I have a better bead on that.What I don&#8217;t like about the HP Deskjet 940c: The manufacturer warranty is too short (only 90 days). The HP drivers install unusually slowly from the CD-ROM (8 minutes on my PC, where software for most printers installs in 2 or 3 minutes). Software uninstallation is also very slow and still leaves a lot of junk behind in the Windows Registry. Queue up four or more print jobs and you&#8217;re likely to experience a Windows print job lockup halfway through which requires ctrl-alt-deleting and reloading print jobs to recover, especially in the speedier Draft mode, with the current driver version. Envelope printing on a stack of up to 15 envelopes is prone to paper skips and jams within the printer in Draft mode; in Normal mode, a stack of envelopes feeds through much better. Documentation to show the user how to find or use useful features such as the onscreen ink level display, the Cancel Print button, and the single envelope slot is missing or confusing. I consider these defects minor, overall.Quality: Text in Draft mode appears a little dim but reasonably crisp to the naked eye (though a magnifying glass shows otherwise). I consider Draft mode good enough for all but critical applications, and of course, frequent use of it will reduce ink cartridge replacement costs. Normal mode looks outstanding even under a strong magnifying glass. I saw no advantage to using Best mode for text. A photo printed on photo paper in Best mode was indistinguishable from a photo printed by a camera shop. It&#8217;s easy and quick to change the default printing mode onscreen. Speed: Advertised printer speeds are always inflated, like monitor screen sizes and modem speeds. HP quotes &#8220;up to 12 pages per minute&#8221; for the 940c. Of course, speeds vary depending on setups. So how fast is the 940c, really? I connected it to USB (parallel port is likely slower) and ran tests printing pages of all black text with Word97 in Win98, with double-spaced 12 point font, on a PII-400 with 128k of RAM. I came up with average speeds of 8.75 ppm in Draft mode, 4.1 ppm in Normal mode, and 3.0 ppm in Best mode&#8230; very good speed for this price. Adding graphics, as usual, slows things down considerably, especially in Normal mode. A 4x6 photo, Best mode on photo paper, printed in under two minutes.The Deskjet 940c uses an HP#15 black ink cartridge, and either a low-capacity or high-capacity HP#78 tri-color cartridge. You can purchase accessories I haven&#8217;t tested from HP to allow automatic two-sided printing or networked printing. The 940c comes with a power cable, a black ink cartridge, and a low-capacity tri-color cartridge; you need to supply either a USB cable (with Win98 or higher) or an IEEE 1284-compliant (newer than 1997 or so) parallel cable to connect it to a PC.",electronics

B000063W8P,4/5,4.0,"This product deserves a 5 star review. The tripod itself is very sturdy, supports a wide range of heights (including its lowest height which works nicely for macro shots), and it is light and compact (which makes it great for travel). Top that off with a great price, and you've got a great tripod. Here's why I gave it 4 stars:The product's accessory list is categorized incorrectly on Sony's website. If you look up the Cybershot DSC-N2, and click on it's supported accessory list, the VCT-D680RM Remote Control Tripod is listed (currently, as of writing this review). Furthermore, if you open Sony's description for the VCT-D680RM Remote Control Tripod, it directly lists the DSC-N2 as compatible.Note that the DSC-N2 is only HALF compatible. It will fit just fine on the tripod itself, but it will NOT work with the remote control features. The DSC-N2 doesn't have an ACC jack, which is necessary to make use of the tripod's remote control features on a digital camera. I've called up Sony and discussed the problem, and they agree that the product is mislabeled. They've been very helpful as far as customer service goes, considering the fact that I didn't purchase the tripod directly from them. They even offered a full refund on the product directly from them. Hopefully they'll update their website soon so this doesn't confuse anyone else.This is why I'm giving the tripod a 4 star review. The tripod itself is great, but the documentation is incorrect. On that note, this is still an excellent choice for a tripod. If you're willing to spend more money, you can upgrade to the VCT-1500L tripod, which will give you an extra 2 inches on the high and low end of the tripod, but I found that the VCT-D680RM gives me plenty of flexibility and travel accessibility, and saved me some money. Even without the use of the VCT-D680RM's remote control features, it's still an excellent tripod, especially at Amazon's price.",electronics

No need to deflate or remove flock from the area, but you have to press down carefully and firmly.2) An internal seam will pop (usually in the middle) and create a huge bubble in the center.

The Apple power cord that came with it wore out very quickly in contrast to any power cord in my life of memories, and was, to my mind, and apparently the mind of others who have purchased the great Macally AC Adaptor, very overpriced for something that needed to be replaced frequently.I replaced the power cord twice before I had enough of it all. Finding that it would take me 1-3 weeks to order an Apple cord again, I decided to check into alternatives. Spent a ridiculously long time on the phone with one of the major outlets that handle Mac equipment only to have them screw up my order on a cosmically absurd level (they had invoiced me for a very expensive flat screen television, which was perhaps reverse psychology - the Apple plug did seem suddenly not so expensive in comparison :)Ultimately found that the outlet neither had the cord that would work with my Mac ibook with a G3 processor nor did they know what kind of cord did (this took about an hour for them to deduce, even when they had invoiced me for an alternative plug.Finally I turned to my heroes at Amazon, read a few reviews on the Apple cord (generally pretty scary) and was directed to this Macally.I LOVE it.

B000HBILB2,0/0,4.0,"I ordered 2 of these for some guests visiting for a couple of days, and they looked like a good balance (not the very cheap/manual pumps and not the very sophisticated ones that cost almost like a new bed)....PROS- Very compact packaging. You can (with some effort even put it back in the bag, as show in the photos/ads)- Good and intuitive pump (just turn left/right to inflate/deflate and plug in the power outlet)- Wide enough. Although it's a twin, sometimes these twin air mattresses are tiny and can fit only kids. This is a really good side bed.CONS- The top of the bed is not flat/smooth (has the wavy look as you can see if you look closer in the photo). So it's best to have a thich sheet on it, to make it feel even.Overall, a good value, doesnt take too much space and pump makes it easy/quick to set it up",electronics

B0000DFZ6A,2/2,5.0,"I bought it several months ago. I gave it 5 stars because it fits my scanning needs and worked without a glitch from the git go. Portability is a big plus. Whenever I need it away from home, I just put it in my backpack along with my laptop.As one of the previous customers mentioned, this model saves images only in .max paperport format. This is very inconvenient indeed. However if you use OCR software with the scanner it usually lets you save scanned images in TIFF (lossless) format recognizable by image editing programs like Adobe Photoshop. That's how I scan images on this one.I mostly use this scanner for OCR (Optical Character Recognition), and it works smoothly with Abbyy FineReader. So, no issues here with TWAIN compatibility. Scanning speed at 300-600 dpi for grayscale and b&w; is adequate.I wish the underside of the cover would be black not white. When scanning text, it would prevent bleeding through from the back of the page.For under $80 with no tax and free delivery, it's a good buy.",electronics
B0000DFZ5X,1/1,5.0,"Pros: Style, Easy to work with, Lightweight. Good cooling. Noise -reducuing grommets for the Hard Drives. It's Silver!Oh, and did I mention that it's got a JEWELRY BOX? (OK, so they call it a ""Tool Box"")Cons: Being very light and made of aluminum, it can transmit noises a bit more than a steel case, so one should chose quieter components. The included case fans are noisy at 12v, but can be made to run on 5v or 7v with little noise.I use mine as a Bedroom Media PC whose primary purpose is being a TV set/recorder. With a Pentium M based system and a very quiet Seasonic PSU (S12-330) there is no need for the noisy case fans to be turned on. As a result, this system is virtually silent and cannot be heard from across the room. The unique SILVER and Chrome finish looks great against a white bedroom set, and connecting the front case fan (at reduced voltage) results in a blue night light.

B000063W95,3/3,1.0,"I bought this printer new, when it was HPs top of the line. I have been very disappointed in it from day one.The print quality is fine. The duplexer is a joke. It needs the bottom of the page to grip the paper, so it can not print on that area. The driver software gives you two options to deal with this - print everything at about 90% scale to squeeze the content into the printable space, or re-sort the pages allowing the SW to move the page breaks. Neither is appealing, so I found that I reverted to manual duplex mode - taking the paper out and reversing itself myself.The biggest problem I have with the printer is frequent paper jams. Even when using HP brand multipurpose paper, I find that the printer jams about 25% of the time. In the quest for speed, the paper load mechanism is just too fast, pulling in many sheets of paper instead of just one.",electronics
B0000DFZ2U,1/1,5.0,"When you are traveling, often you have two competing problems. One, you need to pack as lightly as possible to avoid outrageous charges. Two, you absolutely need to protect your laptop or other device from iffy power. The APC Personal SurgeArrest 1 Outlet 120V meets both of those needs.This literally plugs into any normal three-prong outlet - and you then plug your own plug into this unit. The unit provides solid grounding and protection for you. Lights illuminate to show you that the system is working. It's about as small as it can get. It's easily portable. And you know you aren't risking your valuable laptop, tablet, or other device to the iffy wiring of the hotel or place you're staying.In addition to the main plug where the PC or other item gets connected, there are also three phone style jacks on the bottom. One is an ""in"" jack where the building signal goes into the unit. The other two are ""out"" jacks for both a handset and a laptop connection.Great as something to always have in your luggage, to ensure your valuable electronic items stay protected.

B0000DFZ67,0/0,4.0,"I personally like the control that the Zen Xtra gives you in organizing and classifying your music. It also creates playlists on the go for you (combining tracks by the same Artist, the same album, or same genre) for easy playback retrieval.The software that it comes with, Creative MediaSource, is great also, however may be a little complicated for new computer users. It lets you edit all track information (Artist, genre, album, track #) regardless of what ID3 tags were used when recording.Also do I need to remind you of the removable battery. Poor iPod users have to shell out almost $100 to get their battery serviced/replaced when its dead. Also you can store, data files, video files, etc. on the Zen Xtra (it's a portable hard drive also)The only negative is the buttons on the case are oddly positioned.Overall I don't recommend this item for newbies.

I did not need the digital camera built in as I already have one. Effects are fun to play around with, especially with the handy scroll button.

B0000DFZ67,7/8,4.0,"I've had my Zen Xtra 40Gb for just over a year now. Up until now I have never had an issue with it. A lot of complaints that have been sent the Zen's way seem to have been a result of either ignorance or negligence.Complaint 1: The sound quality is average...Well it depends on what you call good quality sound. If you are from Europe and your idea of good sound is cranking up the music higher than anyone else in the area, then perhaps - if you did not upgrade your firmware with the US firmware (which does not have a volume limiter)- you are incorrect. I am a musician(trained to hear good sound) and with a good set of headphones/earphones, the Jukebox is out there beating the competition. Do yourself a favour and upgrade your firmware. You'll notice an immediate difference in the way it plays.Complaint 2: The Control Buttons are inconvenient in comparison to the iPodI couldn't disagree more heartily. I did a comparison with my father's iPod and immediately realised that navigating the iPod blindly while carrying it on the belt would be a very difficult task indeed. Instead, the Zen's side controls allow for blind navigation as each button serves as an individual function button. Perfect for rush hour on the tube when you want your player out of sight, but accessible...Complaint 3: The iPod has more features.Perhaps. Although I don't know if the iPod's playback menu items are near as comprehensive as the Zen's. For example: on the Zen it is possible to search for: a track, an artist, an album or a genre. Something the iPod doesn't seem to be able to do.Complaint 4: The Zen is flimsy.As with any portable device, the first thing you should do for it is get a case. Mine has never left its case except for the odd clean here and there. The case is tight-fitting, robust and has a belt-clip. Abuse or neglect any computer and it will give you hassles...This machine is tough, its good-looking (although not as good looking as the iPod), has awesome sound with a feature rich interface (there's always a pleasant surprise in the form of a menu-shortcut or an added feature springing up somewhere) and after 4639 songs, it still has 16Gb of free space. Nothing wrong with that!My only complaint is with regards to Creative's software. Now Creative make damn good hardware, but their software sucks to be honest with you. I am quite savvy when it comes to computer related stuff, but Creative's Media Source software is just aweful and buggy and so damn ugly. I eventually went across to Red Chair and bought their Notmad software which really does bring out the potential of the Zen and even adds some enhancements such as faster transfer of songs between the Zen and PC, streaming music from the player to the PC etc, etc... Do yourself a favour and don't even bother opening up Creative's solution!For the sake of their software alone, I am dropping a star off my rating. I would give the hardware a 10 out of 5 and the software a minus 6 leaving us with four stars. Thats fair I think. :)In conclusion, I think this is the best, most complete MP3 player on the market(despite all the new competition!!)",electronics

You can download and watch full length movies as well as most other videos and photos. Of course you can download a tremendous number of songs but, for those times when you don't want to bother with downloading new songs or simply want to listen to something different, you can also listen to the built in FM Radio with presets.

This is a feature packed powerhouse at a budget friendly price. If you are looking for the features of an iPod video but don't want to pay the high price then this is the player for you! I would not hesitate for one moment to recommend this fantastic item to everyone. The only one small downside is that in order to charge the battery you need to plug it into your computer.

B0000DFZ67,26/27,5.0,"I just sold my Archos 20GB Jukebox Recorder after not being satisfied with it's slow loading & difficult navigation, not to mention it froze quite a bit. I was in search of a new item to take it's place as my new MP3 Player/Harddrive. For an early Christmas gift, I got a Zen Xtra 40 GB player. I refused to go for an iPod, I am not going to spend all that money just for the Apple name and because it is ""trendy"" to have that player. This was the closest alternative and best buy for this type.After receiving my Zen Xtra player...I will just say this: I will NEVER go back to my Archos again!!So easy to set up, had some problems with my Archos. Stayed up all night trying to figure out that thing. Just easily drag and drop files into the Nomad explorer and from there you easily alter ID tags and sort your music according to your liking, by artist, song title, genre, etc.Not only is it functional and runs super smooth & fast, but it is also eye candy. Very sleek & stylish as well as the screen options and visuals it has. The leather case it comes with is pretty nice, similar to a PDA style case and does hold and protect it perfectly. All the buttons & neccessary lil' gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand.The sound quality is also nice...after I hooked up my Sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with. Lots of sound options, has an equalizer almost like Winamp with the options. Navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch. Also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player. It was impossible to do so before. Oh, and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet ^_^Another plus in my book, NO file limits!!! I was limited to 999 files in a playlist with Archos' OS, now I can have as many as I want. I have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up.I am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder. Now I can transport files to friends house with ease. When plugged in, it doesn't lag the computer like the Archos did...unless you are doing a MASSIVE transfer of data in one load.After playing with this little device, I don't know why I would look at an iPod with the same space when it costs $500 and I got mine for a little more than half that price!I really have no complaints over this unit. I really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player.

The fluid head panning is just about as good I could expect. Smooth and steady. The tripod shoe is nice and has a cork pad to protect the bottom of your camera.The tripod would be a good buy for just its basic features, but what sets it apart is the LANC remote control built into the handle. Its great. LANC (or Control-L) compatable cameras are made by Sony (this is a Sony product) and Canon and some others.On the handle you have a On/Standy switch, a Record button, a Photo button, and a Zoom rocker. For the stuff we've done so far its super. I can keep my hands on the handle get the shots I want.The remote control makes the makes using the camcorder on the tripod a slick experience.The only thing that would make this a better deal is if they added a Focus Control to the remote. As far as usage - the only other issue is it took a while to get a feel for how much to tighten the tilt knob to lock it down - i didn't want to over-torque it and break something and didn't want the camera slowly moving either - but once you get the feel its fine.This tripod is a good buy. But don't feel like you have to run out and get one. We like being the only cool and geeky ones.",electronics
B0000DFZ67,6/8,5.0,"I purchased this player last week. I did a little research on the web and this is the player I decided on. I refuse to buy anything made by Apple and the Nomad is about $200 cheaper anyway. I have had no problem what-so-ever with this product. The software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my Windows 2k machine. The headphones aren't the best, but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity. The battery life seems good, takes very lttle time to charge, it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs. Took me a few tries to get use to the navigation, but it's a very user friendly player IMO. I haven't messed with the firmware at all, the player worked perfect for me right out of the box. All-in-all, this is another excellent Creative product. If you have the money and need 40 GB, this is the player for you. It's small, light and nice looking and the display is decent as well.

B0001YXWVO,3/3,5.0,"I discovered the Macally Adapter courteous of a Mac Genius after I had left my orignial Powerbook adapter at work before leaving on a trip. I happened to be staying near a mall with an Apple store, so I went in to purchase an original Apple Powerbook adapter. Unfortunately, the Apple store was sold out of their adapters, but the Mac Genius allowed me to charge my laptop at the counter. While sitting at the counter, the friendly Mac Genius showed me the Macally Adapter when he had a break between helping customers and told me it worked great.I ordered one from Amazon and use it has my home charger while carrying the Apple charger when traveling. For the money, it is a great backup charger, and now I don't have to unhook and fish my Apple charger through holes on my desk to the surge protector for all my other computer peripherals.Rather than look like the Apple charger for Powerbooks/iBooks, the Macally charger is like most PC chargers. It's has two separate cords, the cord with the AC plugs is permanately attached to the rectangular white piece, while the cord that plugs into the Apple can be disconnected from both the laptop and the rectangular piece. It doesn't have the Apple orange/green filter and light at the tip of the plug, but I can simply look at the top right corner of my laptop to see if I'm charging versus using battery power.This adapter has Apple beat in the length of the cord itself more than doubling the length of the Apple adapter. Apple's cord is approx 6 feet, while the Macally measures over 12 feet.This is an excellent replacement or secondary adapter.For those frequent travelers:How many times have you checked into a hotel, and tried to find an electrical outlet near the desk or someplace you might actualy use. I travel 14 days each month and found a solution.One of the most useful tools on the road is a simple 9' White Extension Cord.....so many hotels have outlets behind beds and only one outlet available. Carrying an extension cord overcomes the pre-computer, pre-cell phone layout of many hotels. I carry a white extension cord not to match my Apple stuff, but so I don't leave it behind when checking out of the hotel. The white cord is more visible compared a black or brown one.Hope my extension cord tip is useful to some of you.",electronics

B000EVS4YY,3/4,5.0,"This battery appears to be a genuine Canon battery. It was shipped to me promptly. The battery holds a charge well and runs the camera for a substantial period of time. It does not appear to self-discharge unusually quickly. It has neither leaked nor caught fire. I have not instrumented the battery so as to evaluate the charge capacity. Just how much can you say about a battery? Now, if you want to talk about the camera that this is for, the Canon SD800, then we can have a conversation! It's great! Especially the wide-angle end. That is why I purchased the SD800. Many potential camera buyers never pay attention to the wide-angle end of the zoom lens on a digital point-and-shoot camera, but when you're trying to take a group photo indoors, you really notice how wide the lens can go. The SD800 is 28mm wide (using the standard 35mm equivalent), which is SUBSTANTIALLY better than the usual 38mm or worse that most cigarette-pack-size digital point-and-shoot cameras have. You would do well to take this sort of thing into consideration the next time you hunt for a digital point-and-shoot. And, the colors!

Its taken more than its fair share of bumps and bruises and has never skipped a beat. While many of the guys here have opted for MP3/CD players, they are constantly cleaning the lenses and the moving parts often get fouled with sand and dust. The Zen Xtra is a sealed unit with no moving parts other than the rocker wheel on the side. While I agree that the wheel could be a little more responsive sometimes making it a little difficult to make your selection, this is an outstanding piece of equipment. Once the MP3's are uploaded to the unit (I have well over 5,000), you can generate your own playlists and sort by artist, album, or genre. It even has a sleep and wake function. Its a little larger than the iPod but I think its a bit sturdier as well. I know that I'm quite impressed with my purchase and my platoon enjoys it as well.

B0000DFZ67,5/9,3.0,"I got my zen xtra a little bit more then a week ago. It was not my first choice. I have done a lot of research before I decided to buy the Nomad zen xtra. One good thing, it is 40 Gb of disk space (well, it is 38 gb in reality). For the price and features it is really good. One thing, before buying this player I have called the Creative tech. support and asked them if I can navigate by folders beside artist/album and answer was Yes. Sure enough there is no such ability. Not sure, if customer rep. did not know the product exactly, it is still new or they just give an anser which users would like to hear. In any case, navigation by artist/album is ok however I miss an ability to navigate by folders. You even can not navigate by genre/artist/album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre, no other division. Creative is talking about updating it via firmware, however after following some while the descussion groups for Nomad players, looks like Creative represents mostly bug fixes in their firmware updates, not too much of new features. The software, which comes with player is not good at all. I did not managed to make Creative nomad explorer to work. After installing it and trying to make it working for 30 minutes I went and bought Notmad. Notmad worked right away after install and it is what I would like to see from the product. Transfer files is easy using Notmad, however again, would be great if Nomad supported folders like Iriver, RCA Lyra and some other. Often I fill I need to have better organization for the library and there is not enought of variables. Artist, album and Genre are only mp3 tags which are supported buy this player, and if you have 100 artists would be good to have another subcategory. After all those players have 40-60 GB of hard drive, so better organization is required.

B000MQJ19S,1/1,3.0,"I will start by saying I am pretty picky and that's why still do not own an MP3 player myself. Anyway, I bought the Sansa View 8GB for my father, who wanted a microphone to record live lectures and other stuff. I had to set it up and got to test the player quite a bit, so here is my impression based on one-month experience:GOOD:+ Works fine, decent capacity and price ($110)+ Lots of features, including FM radio and microphone recording+ Good sound, no major software bugs or freezesBAD:- Number one for me is the poor music organization and PC sync-up! I cannot understand why would a player need two different modes of connecting to a PC, any file loaded on the player in one mode is invisible when the PC is connected in the other mode?!? Total nonsense! On top of everything these modes are NOT documented in the user manual! I am a pretty tech-savvy engineer and still wouldn't bet I got all the kinks of the two modes after quite a bit of web-reading and experience...- The player doesn't pick up album tracks from the file tag. I read that in one of the modes that should be fixed, but it didn't work for me, so you can either listen to an album in pseudo-random (alphabetical) order or add the track number to the names of the tracks. Imagine doing that for a collection of several thousand songs...- No support for self-converted audiobooks. I converted a CD audiobook, but had to put it under ""podcasts"" to separate from the rest since ""audiobooks"" is RESERVED for special format books only from Audible. What a crap!- FM radio and mic recording are hard to rename and put back on the player as recordings (if you care).- Poor selection of docking stations with speakers (as compared to hundreds for iPod)- The package does not include a charging power supply (only a USB cable, which can be used for that if you care).Overall, I bought this player after serious market review and would still recommend it to anyone who is buying. I, myself, will hold off for a while more until I see something better.

The reviews helped ease my mind about using another party replacement for the adapter as well, and for the 1st few months everything seemed ok,although I kind of wished the connection seemed more secure. Unfortunately, in the past 2-3 months or so, I'd noticed the somewhat 'loose' fit of the plug had gotten worse, so much so that just adjusting the laptop on my legs would mean it often falls out. At this point, now I have to keep checking the connection to make sure it's still inside the Mac. I'll glance up at the battery indicator and won't see the charging icon, but rather that my battery's being used for God only knows how long. Then I'll have to press the plug back in again. I took the Macally adapter out one day to look at it closely and discovered what the real issue is: the thin metal ring around the 'male' charging piece has a slight split/bend in it, which means it isn't fitting snugly in the Mac's charging portal. I don't know how long this has been there. I'm pretty careful w/ my Mac stuff, so I'm relatively sure it wasn't damaged from being wound up in my laptop case and I *know* I wouldn't be jamming the thing into this expensive hardware, so I'm at a loss. I only know it never really fit in the charge slot correctly from word-go and now it's just barely staying in long enough to keep the charge unless I'm absolutely still. I'm really disappointed in this. I'm hoping to get it replaced under the mfgr warranty. If not, I'm certain not to repeat my mistake by purchasing another Macally adapter.

The Internal memory and the Micro SD card show up as different devices in Media Player but the music list on the Sansa screen looks like it's all one.No more spending an hour trying to get three or four songs synced to my I-Pod.

It also has a web based streamer with it to play songs via WinAMP streaming from other machines. The cons to the unit is that it has a history of headphone and USB jack problems, plus the faceplate is a little to quick to pop off when the case is not on it. The case annoyingly, covers up the face and power jacks. The power jack isn't a big deal, but the face is.

B000HBILB2,0/0,4.0,"I ordered 2 of these for some guests visiting for a couple of days, and they looked like a good balance (not the very cheap/manual pumps and not the very sophisticated ones that cost almost like a new bed)....PROS- Very compact packaging. You can (with some effort even put it back in the bag, as show in the photos/ads)- Good and intuitive pump (just turn left/right to inflate/deflate and plug in the power outlet)- Wide enough. Although it's a twin, sometimes these twin air mattresses are tiny and can fit only kids. This is a really good side bed.CONS- The top of the bed is not flat/smooth (has the wavy look as you can see if you look closer in the photo). So it's best to have a thich sheet on it, to make it feel even.Overall, a good value, doesnt take too much space and pump makes it easy/quick to set it up",electronics
B000N7613A,4/5,5.0,"I was at first concerned that a cable that cost so little (and probably what it should actually cost) may have some issues with quality. Be cautious of who you buy your cables from. I specifically bought these ""inspire"" HDMI cables from Clear AV for their quality. People have had alot of complaints over cheap HDMI cables not performing well with their Playstation 3 in full 1080p. This is not true with these cables. They perform just as well as the Monster cables some pay $50-100 or more for.I have noticed alot of confusion on how the HDMI cables are listed between all the various Amazon stores. Just makes sure you are buying them from Clear AV. You wont be disappointed and the customer service is great, which to me is more important than the products I buy.JUST GIVE THEM A TRY!!!These cables meet the latest standards in data transfer rates.Cables are pretty much cables but when it comes to HDTV/HDMI quality cables you need to make sure they are quality manufactured. Especialy since HDMI cables have specifications they need to meet. (Such as 5GHz and later technologies will need 1.3B Certified cables which these could very well be. HDMI is a later design of it's sister cable DVI; which was bulkier so you couldn't do in-wall installs, didn't carry HD audio, and a few other areas)",electronics

B000MQJ19S,1/1,2.0,"Disclaimer- I've only used this for audio. I haven't tried to watch any videos on it, so I can't speak to that functionality.Pro:- Good looking unit, good sound quality- Easy navigation through the menusCon:- It's not easy to create/ maintain playlists on this unit. I've had other Sansa models before and those were difficult in their own right. This one's worse. If I'd known how bad it was before I bought it, I might not have gotten it at all.- Proprietary cable. I know this is a common practice in the electronics industry, but it's still annoying. Instead of using a common cable (like a mini-USB), they have their own connector. So you have to keep that cable on-hand if you need to recharge the MP3 player.- Locks up once in a while. While playing a song, if I try to skip to the next song or change the volume, sometimes it locks up for 15-20 seconds. It keeps playing whatever it was on, and then eventually reacts to whatever I'd tried to do previously. It's minor and rare, but annoying.- The battery died. I plugged it into my computer to recharge it. The battery meter shows 100%, so I unplugged it. It still thinks that it's ""charging"". It was like that for 2 days. I had to hold down the power switch for a few seconds to force it to reboot. Very counter-intuitive; I would expect that removing the external power source would give it enough information to figure out that it's no longer charging. Apparently I expect too much.All in all, I don't think that I would recommend this product.",electronics
B0000DFZ6L,8/9,4.0,"I wanted a product to convert a career's worth of consulting notes into .pdf files, which will let me access them on my laptop and throw out several filing cabinets full of paper.So far, the Xerox 510 lives up to its billing. You can just add stacks of paper to the document feeder, walk away, and come back to add more. The ability to scan one side of a stack of papers, and then scan the other side (while it organizes them back in order) is very nice. It does take a little bit of finessing, since it can be very touchy on paper jams.A couple of minor problems that could be fixed in a later model: 1. The scanning application demands to be run in the foreground, so if you want to do something else on your computer while it scans, you have to work around a window in the middle of your screen. 2. It does not resolve errors very well at all. Most errors require a reboot, and don't even attempt to stop the process in the middle of a scan. Also, don't try to go for the full 50 pages in the document feeder. If it can't grab the first page, it'll force you to reboot.A few other tricks: When I first started scanning, I was getting jams every 100 pages or so. Now I get one less than every 500 pages. It likes well-thumbed pages better than new, perfectly cut paper (easier to grab). Also, for some reason when I did not open the paper feed extension all the way my jams decreased dramatically. 300 dpi (10 sec/page) works for most of my scans, unless there are very small fonts which require 600 dpi (30-40 sec/page).All in all, a very good product.",electronics

B0000DFZ67,18/18,3.0,"I've owned all three 40GB players available today: Creative Zen, RCA Lyra, Apple iPod. This is the review I wish I had read before I started shopping. It was a originally more comprehensive but I had to trim it to 1000 words.For the most part, the Creative Zen has the best features of the three, as well as the best price. It sounds like a no brainer except for the fact that these things break like crazy! If you read some of the other reviews on here, you'll see a few people mention that their headphone jack shorted out when they dropped the player....well mine shorted out while the player was sitting on my desk not moving at all. I don't know a single person who bought one of these players and didn't have their headphone jack malfunction! Many reviewers suggest buying an extended warranty because of this problem. I would most definitely agree with them on that one, but personally I don't have the patience to wait a few weeks every time the player decides to stop working. Those warrantees are supposed to be purchased just in case something goes wrong; not because something most likely will! The Lyra from the moment it came out of the box to the moment it stopped working for no apparent reason, four hours later, was on the whole a piece of junk. That said...on to the comparisons.PRICE: As just about every anti-iPod reviewer mentions, THE IPOD IS MORE EXPENSIVE AND DOES PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THING. The iPod is basically the BMW of mp3 players...the other mp3 player work like, and cost about as much as a Kia. They all do basically the same thing, but the cheaper ones are cheaper for a reason!SIZE: All three players are smaller than a walkman, so it's kind of silly to even discuss this, but it seems to be a hot topic in the other reviews. From largest to smallest the players are ranked as follows: Lyra, Zen, iPod. The Lyra is the only one of the three which will not fit easily in your pocket. It is the widest /longest /heaviest of the bunch, and personally, I hated the way it felt in my hand. The Zen and the iPod were both a pleasure to hold.CONTROLS/NAVIGATION: iPod gets first place here simple because it's touch sensitive navigation wheel allows you to get from the first album in your collection to the last in seconds and it stops on a dime anywhere in between. The Zen's controls are very good however it takes longer to scroll through your entire collection and when it really starts moving fast, it continues scrolling after you release the button sometimes skipping past another 50-75 albums! The Lyra had decent navigation, but the buttons had to be pushed more than once before they responded almost half of the time! The Zen and the iPod can be operated easily with one hand.PLAYLISTS/SONG RATING: The Zen wins here without a doubt. It is the only one of the three where you can create, edit (even while it's playing) and SAVE multiple play lists on the player itself without connecting it to a computer. The iPod allows you to make ONE play list on the fly, which cannot be edited or saved.The Lyra allows you to tag songs you like or don't like and it makes play lists of each...yes, it makes a playlist of songs that you tell it you DO NOT LIKE...if that doesn't explain what's wrong with this product, nothing will! The iPod allows you to rate songs 1-5 stars on the player, and then make a play list automatically based on those ratings when connected to a computer.BATTERY: Again, Zen is the winner here. Not only does it offer a battery that lasts 14 hours instead of iPod and Lyra's 8 hour batt. it is also the only player of the three where you can remove and replace the battery when it deteriorates with age as all rechargeables do. It should be noted that the battery times I listed are the official times given by the manufacturers. The Zen actually lasts about 10 hours the other two go between 5 and 6 before needing a charge.SCREEN: The Zen not only has the biggest screen of the bunch, it also scrolls the album title in the directory screen allowing you to see the whole thing instead of just the first few words.TRANSFER TO PLAYER: All three units use USB 2.0, the iPod also can be used with Firewire.TRANSFER FROM PLAYER: The Zen allows you to transfer music freely from your player to any computer loaded with it's software. The iPod does not allow this however third party software that can be purchased and used to pull songs from the iPod. In all honest, the Lyra broke before I could find out if you can pull songs off of it. &lt;/P&gt;SOFTWARE: iTunes is easy to use and offers tons of ways to organize your music. Creative Media Manager takes a lot of getting used to but is decent once you figure it out. Musicmatch, which comes with the Lyra is garbage. It`s slow, difficult to figure out at times, and constantly badgers you to buy the upgrade to its premium version.EXTRAS: The only one that actually has extra features is the iPod which comes loaded with 4 different games, the ability to read text documents that are stored on the hard drive on the player's screen, a date book, and an address book. The Lyra's ONLY advantage over the other players is the fact that it comes with a complete car kit (charger/tape adapter)....which is pretty nice, but useless when the player turns itself into a paperweight after just a few hours. All three players come with a case....iPod's is the only one which does not give you access to the player's controls when it's in the case.Hope this helped.",electronics

B0000DFZ6L,0/0,1.0,"Apparently my boss doesn't read reviews. I requested a new scanner after my ancient Visioneer 9450 started eating paper for breakfast. I wanted a new brand and found one at a different website for a decent price. Instead, this one was ordered. I figured since it wasn't the same brand it would be better. Until I found it is a Visioneer. I thought perhaps since it was newer it'd be better. I was wrong. I use it for the ADF to scan hundreds of old files into digital files so we can get rid of the paper and reduce storage costs.The PaperPort software has OK settings, it allows you convert into a PDF, single page items, or multipage. The scanning quality is fine. The problems start when scanning. It seems to have trouble scanning one or two pages and randomly jams while it tries to feed the paper crooked. If you're scanning a large mutli-page file and it jams, you have to start the whole document scan over again. PaperPort FREEZES all the time. At first I thought it was neat that you could drag and drop pages onto one another to combine files, but it quickly lost its appeal when it started freezing and I'd have to force close it.The speed of which it scans is pretty poor, and it's FAR from quiet. The pin connector that plugs in the ADF is incredibly large so it doesn't fit in my oversized desk drawer like my previous scanner.I rarely hate devices as much as I hate this one. When scanning hundreds of sheets of paper it just makes the process twice as long and twice as annoying. I'm just hoping it breaks soon so I can get the one I actually wanted.",electronics

Read the directions and use the telephone once or twice with Xerox. After that, it fits. Resolution, JPG, fax, tiff, acrobat, and add-on applications are in a menu bar that pops up when the scanner is on. The release on the scanner provides for paper hangs - that is you want 50 pages in two or three minutes, and are scanned at 150 or 200 dpi for a PDF and a paper jam happens - bad on many scanners, on this scanner, you click up the hood on the scanner, remove the jammed paper and then place the last room in, press continue and it goes about a full file without scanning again. This is the feature that makes it easy and above anything else.The Paperport issues are easy to manage. The program adapts to the factory issue and the light Paperport program included is then upgraded at that time. I have had this item for more than three years. The great feature is as it creates a PDF or file it can be emailed while on the telephone with a client or customer.

B0000DK2Y4,4/4,3.0,"Overall I'd give this product something like 3 1/2 stars, as the device itself is ok, but the way it works with the iPAQ is problematic. The hardware itself is pretty straightforward, although you can charge only either the device or your iPAQ at once, not both at the same time with the car adapter (you can use the iPAQ AC charger to charge the device at home, however). More problematic is the iPAQ itself (in my case, the 5450), which is simply unreadable in the car due to glare--I had to take it out of the holster constantly to read it. The sound at full volume is also barely audible, I had to turn off the AC and radio to hear it; I would check the volume and readability of your PocketPC device in your car before considering this solution. The navigation software is competent, although it is somewhat erratic regarding turns; sometimes it tells you to turn a block before, other times right at the corner. The software will lock up on you (necessitating a reboot) if you don't exit the program before turning your PocketPC off--you can't just turn it off when you reach your destination. The GPS unsurprisingly conks out in tunnels, and can take several minutes to find itself again. It has a tendency to slide around on your dash unless you find a flat spot. The good things about this device? The price--one of the cheaper GPS solutions you can get if you have a PocketPC; portability, you can upgrade your PocketPC device and still use this solution; you can use it with Microsoft Streets (with a bluetooth connection) on a laptop. It's probably best used however with a passenger reading the iPAQ for you.",electronics
B000MQJ19S,1/2,2.0,"I'm on my third Sansa View right now... The main problem that happened to the replaced two was probably heat. When left in the car (even under the cover of glove compartment), it appears that the Sansa View gets too hot and the rotation wheel expands to a degree that it detaches from the sensors inside. The same scenario happened to both of my previous Sansa Views. They were left in the car's glove compartment one day when it was a bit too hot and the rotation wheel stopped working (which renders the unit unusable). I've had other MP3 players before and had even left them on my car seat and they never had this problem.The first issue can be counted as my fault for leaving it in the heat. But another issue with this unit is driving me crazy. I listen to audio books alot. Some of these MP3 files are 1 hour long files. Typically, Sansa View remembers the playing position and resumes the book where I last paused it or turned it off. But sometimes, it resumes the position on the wrong file (like a previous file/chapter), in which case I had to fast forward it to my ""bookmark"". And Sansa View does NOT have a ""fast"" fast-forwarding feature. I literally had to hold down the fast-forward button for several minutes. That was very annoying. Playing music is fine, but for audio books I'd try something else next time.On the side note, I do like SanDisk's return policies and their speed in processing my two replacements. That was good.",electronics
B0001YXWVO,10/10,4.0,"pros--CHEAP. Costs at least $50 less than the Apple product.-more durable than Apple. It feels like you could really smash around the AC adapter and it would still be OK.

The connector to the laptop is an improvement, but is still not great.-Very light, easy to carry around.Cons--not the nice design features of apple - the light at the tip of the cord, the exchangeable plug, the overall appearance etc. (but who cares?) Also doesn't have a three-pronged plug-Does not charge computer as fast as apple, however not significant. Due to lower wattage.-Some heat issues- the adapter seemed to be as hot as or hotter than the Apple one, and it heats my computer up more than the apple one did. I haven't seen this in other reviews though, so it may be my computer or something.In general a good product. It seems fairly well made and will probably last you longer than your apple charger.

B000MQJ19S,4/4,4.0,"This is my second Sansa mp3 player, the first being an e260, so I kind of knew what to expect.As expected, it's a great mp3 player with the ability to play videos.It's very thin and has a very nice finish to it. I like the controls on the View vs the e200, the scroll wheel is where you press instead of having buttons outside of the scroll wheel.I bought a silicone case and armband for it and the fitment is perfect.The only hang up I have is the Sansa Media Converter. You can drop in all kinds of movies and have it convert them to video your View can play, but not only is it slow, but you have to leave the View plugged in while it's converting. I use Any Video Converter to convert to MPEG4 (the free version works great) and then drag & drop on the View.It does hang every once in a while for about 10 seconds, but only the controls/display, the music keeps playing. There was a firmware update that GREATLY improved this, but SanDisk rolled back to the previous version because it would kill the battery in about half the time, or less.Overall, I'm very satisfied with it.Oh, and it doesn't have a place for a lanyard like the e200 series does. Sometimes I like to hang it around my neck while at work because I don't use the arm band unless I'm running or at the gym.",electronics
B0000DFZ67,4/4,4.0,"And also, it's priced very affordably. With 40gb of storage I have about 7,500 songs on the player (everything music file I have is on there) with room for about 2,500 more. A similarily priced 15gb Ipod wouldn't have been nearly enough room. Having my entire music collection is great when travelling (both on plane and car trips) and I don't have to decide what to bring or copy onto the player--it's all there. Having to copy/delete files would be time-consuming and is rendered a non-issue with 40gb of storage. The software interface supplied was very easy to use but I went ahead and got Red Chair's &quot;Notmad&quot; software because of some advanced features I wanted. The sound is great even with the supplied earbuds--but I find earbuds uncomfortable so I use different headphones. On planes I use a splitter so two headphones can be plugged in for two people and the sound is equally good. Sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference. Accessing files by artist and album (I mostly look things up by artist) is easy and intuitive. Possibly the biggest advantage this player has (if price wasn't enough) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him/herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery. Since batteries do run out on everything, this will also be a big money-saver since Ipods, Irivers, RCA, Dell, all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician (Apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement). Try before you buy if at all possible: although I am a Mac addict now for over a decade and everyone I know has previously bought an Ipod, the Nomad Zen Xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface. I personally am not crazy about the looks of either the Ipod or the Nomad. The Ipod's white plastic look/surface doesn't suit me. I like the Nomad's color better, but it's not terribly flashy. The mini Ipod's look the best to me--but with only 4gb there's no way I would ever buy any mp3 player with a measly 4gb of storage. My advice to mp3 buyers: consider how much storage space you will need, then try and listen before you buy--mp3 players can only fully evaluated by holding and listening to them.",electronics

Old camera used to have auto date time option that displayed the date and time for about 5 seconds on first recording of the day, and wouldn't display it again until day changed. Not so with this as far as I can figure.3) Eyepiece view kind of small. Have to use this in really bright sun when you can't see the LCD screen.This is discontinued and you can get it now for $$$ if you can find it. I'm going to purchase the SCL-860 because it is same camera but newer version with image stabilization, photo mode, and remote control for $$$ ....",electronics

This one had pretty good reviews and it was taller when inflated and would be easier to get on and off it. I did like the airbed and it was comfortable. We used it less than 5 times over the last 4 months and it deflated slightly last time I used it. I should have investigated further at that time but just deflated it until next use.

Not too many consumer level printers will do that.,electronics
B000063W94,4/4,4.0,"... I haven't been disappointed! This is simply a great little printer. It's lightning-fast, very, very quiet, and doesn't complain a bit. I haven't had a single paper jam or other problem with it.The 940c has separate cartridges for black and for color, which is really great for someone who primarily prints out black and white documents. Further the print heads are within the cartridges themselves, so no more messing around trying to clean heads. This does mean, however, that one must align the heads every time one takes out or replaces the cartridges; fortunately, this is a relatively quick process with the included software.Photo quality is allegedly outstanding, but in all honesty, I haven't purchased any photo print paper yet to test this myself, and of course photos printed out on plain paper are completely sub-standard. Color documents look very nice on plain paper, though.Set-up was easy, although I did have a some kind of [glich] during the installation process, and couldn't print anything other than test pages - no other programs could print. I'm still not certain what happened, and reinstalling the software immediately took care of the problem. I haven't had any other problems since.Replacement cartridges are assuredly not cheap, in the grand old HP tradition, but for regular home use, this shouldn't be a huge burden.Overall, I'm very impressed with this little device, and would unreservedly recommend it for any home user.",electronics

B000HBILB2,1/1,2.0,"I've owned many air beds, and many of these. How well they will work for you depends on how often you use them. I like them because they maintain even pressure on your body. The reason you move around while you sleep on a non-airbeds is because of the ""hot spots"" that develop from too much pressing in one place for too long. I've also had several AeroBeds, made in the USA, with built in pump and sleep number control, several different and expensive type air springs, and INTEX, made in China, standard rib springs, with separate battery operated plastic pump. They last between 6 weeks and 6 months with the average being around 3 1/2 months. The AeroBed quality was better, more consistent life, but lasts only 20% longer, at 10 times the price. If you go AeroBed, get it from a store that takes care of the warranty for you. I went for years on free AeroBeds until they stopped carrying them. Since I've purchased these.What goes wrong: They all develop small tears NEAR a seam or ""air spring"". The ""air springs"" are what hold the top and bottom together so when you inflate it, so it isn't shaped like a beach ball. They are vertical webs inside of the mattress. There are pillow tops, button tops, cushion tops, and they all last about the same, with a little difference in comfort and stability. The bulges people talk about are these ""air springs"" letting go. The web begins to tear loose from the top and bottom. This results from the normal working hardening of the plastic from flexing. Just like when you bend a piece of metal back and forth it breaks, so to with vinyl. Sometimes this happens NEAR the seam, and but more often NEAR an air spring. It never happens AT the seam or AT the ""air spring"" because it is stiffer there, so the the main flexing occurs right next to it. When you get a tear near a spring, in time the spring will let go and you will get the bulge people talk about. The only thing that bulges without leaks means, is that instead of the tear occurring on the top or bottom mattress surface, it occurred on the web inside the mattress. The more one ""air spring"" tears loose, the faster the other ""air springs"" tear loose because the others now have to take more of the load. And if the mattress is work hardened in one area, it is work hardened in many areas around it. This always happens at the head end where most of your weight is. Your best shot after you develop your first leak, is to swap it end for end, and top to bottom, so the main flexing occurs in a new area that is less ""work hardened"" and thus less likely to fail.They supply patch kits. Those are fine if there has been a puncture. For the far more likely situation described above, the best way to fix the tears is to push liberal amounts of silicone glue into the tear while it's inflated, but not in use. It often requires two tries, but it will work. Vinyl patch kits don't work at all. Of course you can see that this will be very short term. You will have more leaks within days.What I have stated is true of ANY air bed that is made of vinyl, ANY. The ""we use thicker high quality vinyl, and built by hand"" is snake oil. The ONLY ones that will last are quality vulcanized rubber air beds, but you will have to pay real money for them. So your choices are:1. Use it as a temporary bed for occasional overnighters. Little kids that won't jump on them would be the best.2. Budget $6.00/mo. for your bed.3. Buy a vulcanized rubber one, and never be ""let down"".",electronics

B0000DFZ67,4/4,3.0,"Overall, a good buy for the price. Easy enough to navigate through, although I'd prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll/pushbutton. My biggest complaint is the battery life or lack there of. There is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours! At best, I've gotten 3 hours+. I've tried draining it until it won't turn on &amp; recharging it overnight. No difference. If you're intrested in buying a spare battery It'll run you another $50, a little steep I thought. I've also had the Nomad Zen lock-up several times. The good news is if you can't get it to reset/reboot you can still pull the battery and reinstall it. That's a huge plus by itself compared to the infamous IPod and similar MP3 players where the battery is permanently installed &amp; removing it voids the warranty. The Nomad Zen could use a little sturdier construction like the Archos Jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case. At the very least, a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice.Pros: huge storage capacity for the price, easy to navigate, can modify existing playlists on the fly, has a removable batteryCons: Battery life is about 1/4 of that advertised, no operators manual available for any of the Nomad Zen players (on or off-line), occasional software lockups, replacement battery is expensiveNote: about 2GB (5%) of the advertised 40GB of storage capacity is used for the operating software (Firmware).

B0000DFZ67,10/12,5.0,"This is an excellent player, especially for the price, with features that are comparable to and even excel the Ipod. For a price that's still less than even the lowest level Ipod I was able to get this 40GB monster, and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some.Here are the pros and cons (few there are) in detail:Look/Design: The system is terrific in size and design, IMO looking better than the Ipods. It's bigger, but people have grossly exaggerated the size differences- it's only about half an inch longer and 1/3 inch thicker than the new-generation Ipods. It's very solidly built, and has a nice dense feel to it. I find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least. The scroll wheel is better than the Ipod's as well, in that you don't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly- just a small nudge of the finger and you're there. The screen's large and easily read. The only beef I can raise in this regard is the pop-off face, that sometimes comes off a bit easily, but besides that it's perfect.Sound: Exceptional, though I can't really compare it to the Ipod. From what I've heard it's at least equal. Like others have mentioned, you can manage to hear new things in songs even though they're on lower bit levels. There's no so-called background hiss that I've noticed, at least so far.Interface- Practically seamless. Songs are recognized automatically by ID3 tags, which at first I was against since I had organized my files by folder with a previous player from Iriver. Yet after ensuring that all the ID3 tags are in order (with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out) it actually turns out to be really handy. It's a dedicated music playing device, anyway, so this serves it better. You can find any song quicky by an artist, album, or genre search. Playlists can be generated on the fly (which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus) or by using the software, and there are a bevy of EQ options. The only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance.Software: As I mentioned before, the Creative Mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said, though Notmad may still work better. It's easy to transfer, preview, and organize files. The in-program ID3 tag editing is a strong point, as well. It was no problem for me to use their software. Some may complain that there's no drag-and-drop capability, but what they should realize is that this is mainly a portable music player, not a computer accessory or hard drive. The software and design are geared towards enhancing the music experience.Overall, I'm giving this 5 stars as I've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over, but as I've only had the player for a while I leave room for doubt if the headphone jack, hissing, or scroll wheel problems show up with me too. So far, however, I'm a very happy customer. Please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an Ipod.",electronics

The device IS USB, so old Win95 systems won't be able to use it, but Since USB is so small it it a great use for the new technology! Unfortunatly, Sony's eMarker website only currently has the support for Win98, but they are developing it for WinME and Macs with USB.I have found myself using it All the time when the DJ doesn't say who sings the 'upcoming song', or if I really like it and might want to purchase the album.You will find it is a great conversation piece since Sony puts their own 'style' on it....'Slime' Green with Orange Accents, pretty hard to miss or ignore!The eMarker holds 10 songs or 'timestamps', but that is fine since you are pretty eager to find out who sung THAT song. When signing up at the eMarker website, you choose your three favorite radio channels, but you do have the option to choose another station in your area after you upload the 'eMark'.Sony has mentioned in their website (as well as the manual) that they will be adding the 'TV' function, so when watching 'MTV' or 'VH1' you will be able to use the eMarker for the same purpose.If you have a Win98 system and can never remember song titles or artists, this is for you!

B0000630MK,4/23,5.0,I exclusively buy Sony Electronics because in my opinion they are the best. When I bought this Camera I knew that the quality would be there because it is a Sony. The camera works well except it is a little bulky. I primarily use this camera to film my son playing in the little league and it works well at capturing high speed action. It also is somewhat impact resistant because at his last little league game the umpire claimed my son was out when he was safe. Everyone knew that except for the umpire himself. I hit that fat porker right in the face with the camera (while it was on) and it captured everything - the picture quality was amazing and the sound was crystal clear. That fat slob hit the floor like a ton of bricks and was out cold. A couple of weeks later I got a letter from his lawyer and I had to appear in court because he filed a lawsuit against me. I showed the judge the tape of my son being safe and even he commented on the quality of the sound and picture and said my son was not out either. The judge dropped the charges all because of this great little camera.,electronics

B000063W94,1/1,4.0,"The HP940C inkjet printer is designed for the home or office. It comes in a light gray case shaped like other HP printers. It connects to a computer with either an IEEE 1284 parallel cable (DOS or Windows) or a USB cable (Windows 98, Me, 2000, XP). The black inkjet cartridge is the #15, the tricolor inkjet cartridge is the #78 (replacing the #17 tricolor cartridges used in earlier printers). This printer works well for the average user. HP has long been the leader in inkjet printing.The paper path is the same U-shaped method used in other HP printers. This minimizes desk space and provides a more compact printer than those that use an oblique paper path. You should connect the cable from the printer to the computer before you apply power to the computer or printer. The power supply is built into the printer and not separate like earlier products. This makes it more difficult to replace if it fails. It is not good practice to keep the printer powered on when not in use; heat is the enemy of electronics.The Quick Reference Guide has a section on pages 7 to 10 for solving installation problems. Be sure to read the warnings on page 69 about proper care of inkjet cartridges. Leaving them unused for many months may shorten their useful life. New cartridges have a plastic tape over the nozzles to prevent oxidation of the ink. Do not refill print cartridges, this can void the warranty.The Quick Help document has chapters on learning about this printer, printing on paper and other media, printer maintenance, problem solving, and specifications. There are five cartridge status lights to identify a problem. Both printer cartridges are required to operate even if one is empty. The Deskjet Toolbox provides functions like cleaning print cartridges. Print cartridges and the print cartridge cradle can be cleaned manually using distilled water and a clean cotton swab.",electronics

As far as coverage and the speed in which certain radio stations provide feedback is the sole responsiblity of that station for the most part (most stations take 24 hours to get a song. others might take maybe 10 minutes or so), and NPR support would be very much appreciated.

This is because I wanted it to work, (really, really) and did all I could before giving up on it. It's a cool little mp3 player and, when it works, the sound quality is great, the screen is very sharp, and it has an appealing and easy to use interface.However it just doesn't work. Some may remember this player was originally billed as the ""Rhapsody"" player by Sandisk. It never, ever worked with Rhapsody, and Sandisk never acknowledged the problem or offered a solution, a total abdication of corporate resposibility to their clients. After numerous hours dowloading firmware, and re-booting, re-setting and returning to the store and trying again, I finally had to accept that this player, although a hugely appealing concept with great potential, would never work. I now have a very expensive, ($140 + tax) portable fm radio, which I really love by the way.Sandisk's solution to this tale of woe, was to simply drop the ""Rhapsody player"" from the name and continue selling. If you do any research at all, you will find the message boards filled with countless clients complaining of the same difficulties: freezin up, an endless dowload indicator which never dowloads anything, an indication that the dowload is complete only to find that no content can be found on the player, etc. You may also find that not only Rhapsody users but regular mp3 users had similar trouble, I never did because I was not interested in using this as a regular mp3 player, so I never tried. I can't report on that, however the message boards are full of complaints.Oh, well. As much as I hate, and resist, hype of any kind: I should have bought an iPod. :-(",electronics

No joke. I find it to print slow but that is not a big deal with me. The print quality is amzing. I have to admit I was extremely skeptical when people told me that the picture quality was as good as pictures from a normal camera.Printers take up lot of think though. I must say the ink is not cheap. I don't print pictures that often becuase of the ink price. But honestly you could not tell the difference between something printed on this printer and a normal photo. The only possible upgrade I could think for this printer is borderless prints. It looks very cool too but it's a bit bulky. It is like a computer. It actually asks you questions while you print stuff. Don't pay 300.00 bucks for it. Buy it off Ebay.com. That is where my family got it. We payed 130.00 dollars for it and that it with shipping. Great deal. It was not refurbished either. It was brand new. Even came with a printer cable too. They have plenty left on there so go get one. One of the best computer purchases of my life. Setup was extremely easy! You can plug it in via printer cable or usb! It comes with the usb cord.

B000063W9B,62/62,5.0,"Overall, I'd like to say that this camera is a beautiful and inexpensive camera with great features. I bought mine at [a physical store] becuase Amazon.com didn't have any in stock but it has 22x optical zoom, and 880 digital zoom which is amazing!! The main reason I bought this camera is beacuse I will be goin to Italy for this summer and also Tunisia and I needed a camcorder, (It is my first one). It has a PAL system built in which means that you can basically use it anywhere in the world. The visuals are great and it has digital effects such as, black and white, fade, black light, mirror, sepia, negative picture, art, mosaic, 16:9, and cinema. Maybe the only bad thing is that it doesn't have an image stabilizer but it doesn't really bother me beacuse the other Samsung that does costs about [much more]. I would reccomend getting a Camcorder bag and an extra Lithium-Ion battery if your going to use it alot. It has two features that one is, EASY which everything advanced is turned off, more for begginers, and then a CUSTOM setting where you can customize everything the way you want it. It comes with the AC Adapter and the cable, a Lithium-Ion battery, hand strap, shoulder strap, lens cover, and AV cables which work great! Another great thing about it is that it is very small and it has a light you can turn on that helps just as good as if you were in a pitch black room and you couldn't see and you turned on a flash light.

B000063W93,21/21,5.0,"I am a first-time camcorder buyer, so I've been researching these for the past couple months. I had my choices narrowed down to the Canon ZR45 and the Sony TRV18. The Canon was smaller, lighter, cheaper, and fit better in my hand than the Sony. Canon wins, right? Well, the one thing that bothered me was reading the reviews about the 'motor whine' during playback. I knew this is one thing that would really bother me. Well, since we are taking a trip to Mexico in a few weeks I had to make my choice. I went ahead and took my chances with the Canon. I went to [...] to select a highly rated(and cheap) online seller. I ended up buying from [...]and had the camcorder within a week. After a few weeks of use, I am extremly happy with my decision. It is very easy to use, and best of all, the motor whine is a non-issue. Yeah, it's there when watching recordings in quiet settings, but I don't really notice it. As a test, I never mentioned the noise to my wife prior to buying the camcorder. I wanted to see if she would notice it not having not previously known about it. Well, she's probably used it more than I have over the past couple weeks and hasn't mentioned a word about the motor noise. Maybe some units are worse than others, but I'm not sure I would even have noticed it either if I wouldn't have read the reviews talking about it. I'm definitely glad I made the purchase. One recommendation - buy an extra battery. The one that comes with the camcorder only lasts about 45 minutes using the LCD. I bought a Lenmar LIC-511 that gives you about 2 hours.",electronics
B000063W94,0/0,5.0,"After 4 years of heavy use, our trusty b&w; HP laser printer died and we decided to go for a color printer. Since we recently got a digital camera, photo quality was a must. After much research, we considered buying a Canon, but went to a store to see if we could get any info about photo printing in general. A young man advised us to go for an HP, showing us pictures he'd taken and printed, and explaining some other points. We did some further research and the main complaint against the 940c was its' tendency to eat paper.We've had this printer for 3 weeks, and it did eat paper and printed unevenly until we discovered that a small door on the back, used to clear paper jams, was not fully closed. Going to HP's website, we learned that the paper guides must be snug and that it works best with stacks of photo paper, rather than 1-2 sheets of photo paper placed on a previous stack of plain paper. We have not had problems with paper feeds since.Overall, this printer is a fantastic value and provides the best bang for the buck you can get. The photo quality is indistinguishable from a 'real' photo. This, however, is dependent on the quality of the photo, as well as the paper used (we have had excellent results with HP's Premium Glossy paper). If the focus of the picture is slightly off, the print will look awful. The photos will look only as good as the original pictures. The plain paper text printing is surprisingly good as well, even in draft mode. Also, the print heads are part of the ink cartridges. This means that they are replaced when you replace cartridges and require no cleaning and less maintenance. As we've discoverd, replacing print heads can be expensive.Pros:* True photo quality* Excellent plain paper text printing* Non-photo printing is fast* Separate color & black ink cartridges* Printing heads are part of ink cartridgesCons:* Photo printing is not that fast, but the quality is worth it* A little bulky, but all inkjets are like that*UPDATE April 2003*Amazing - it still works like new! However, we we have covered our printer since day one as we have cats and wanted to keep the printer cat hair-free. This has also kept our printer dust-free, and we think it has made a difference.

B0000DFZ67,18/18,1.0,"Like many reviewers, I really wanted to like this product. The price/performance looked just right. When I bought it late last year, there were enough reviews that I knew the navigation wheel and software would be less than ideal, but it sounded like a fair tradeoff.Boy was I wrong. Reading the reviews, it looks as though people really love this device for a month or two and then come to hate it. That's been my experience.If I'd been paying attention, I would have noticed the 3 month warranty. But I didn't because I'm used to electronic products having a 12 month warranty. Now I know better. I've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose. A $300 device and they skimped on the headphone jack? So now I've got to call their customer &quot;service&quot; (of course, no 800 number) to send the thing back.From the other reviews I've read, it sounds like that won't be the end of my troubles. I fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because, as other reviewers have pointed out, the construction is pretty flimsy.Now let's talk about the software. Like other reviewers, installation was hell. Subsequent behavior even worse. About 10% of the time it can't find the device when I attach it to my PC. After I had it a couple weeks, it got into a state where it could never find the device, no matter how often I rebooted my PC, reset the device, reloaded drivers, etc, etc. Creative's online support was no help at all. In fact, I'd have to rate it among the worst I've ever encountered.Finally, I uninstalled and reinstalled the software, the usual measure of last resort for this sort of thing. To my amazement, even that process was error-prone. It took several days of attempts before things finally &quot;worked&quot; again and I haven't a clue why. That doesn't leave me with a good feeling about its future stability.I did buy the Notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement. But that's a moot point now. My gut tells me the Nomad will in the long run be, at best, a 40GB portable hard drive, albeit one on which I can't create folders, or, at worst, a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again (I have their Audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating). My gut tells me I'll also end up buying an iPod. Which means that in trying to save a few hundred dollars, I'll end up spending more than twice that.Be forewarned. I would have given a 3 to 5 star review in my first few weeks, depending on how mad I felt about the crummy software. Now, even 1 star seems like I'm giving Creative the benefit of the doubt.",electronics

B000HBILB2,0/0,5.0,This airbed is well worth the price - the twin size makes it easy to travel with when you are just looking for one extra bed but it's plenty big enough to sleep comfortably (and indeed it is comfortable to sleep on). The material is not too noisy if you toss and turn at night. It inflates and deflates quickly and quietly and the built-in pump is so convenient. I'm completely satisfied with this product.,electronics
B000063W90,2/3,4.0,"I love this printer. The quality of the photos print are exceptional.The set up/installation was a breeze except for a mistake (on my part) I had attached the USB and Parallel port at the same time to facilitate a scanner/printer function and this caused no ends of problems.However apart from this the printer is very good, the card reader facility is excellent, I no longer have to hook up the camera and download my photos to my computor, just stick the card in the slot the computor reads this slot as another drive and then drag and drop files from the card reader driver to your drive on the computor.The 4x6 photo paper slot is very convenient.I have two concerns1. This printer seems to use ink especially color very quickly, however this may be because the starter ink cartridge is smaller than the regular sized cartridge - 21ml vs 42ml. I will have to test with a larger size cartridge.2. The printer is a bit noisier than I think it should be.All in all a satisfactory product.",electronics
B000063W94,4/4,4.0,"... I haven't been disappointed! This is simply a great little printer. It's lightning-fast, very, very quiet, and doesn't complain a bit. I haven't had a single paper jam or other problem with it.The 940c has separate cartridges for black and for color, which is really great for someone who primarily prints out black and white documents. Further the print heads are within the cartridges themselves, so no more messing around trying to clean heads. This does mean, however, that one must align the heads every time one takes out or replaces the cartridges; fortunately, this is a relatively quick process with the included software.Photo quality is allegedly outstanding, but in all honesty, I haven't purchased any photo print paper yet to test this myself, and of course photos printed out on plain paper are completely sub-standard. Color documents look very nice on plain paper, though.Set-up was easy, although I did have a some kind of [glich] during the installation process, and couldn't print anything other than test pages - no other programs could print. I'm still not certain what happened, and reinstalling the software immediately took care of the problem. I haven't had any other problems since.Replacement cartridges are assuredly not cheap, in the grand old HP tradition, but for regular home use, this shouldn't be a huge burden.Overall, I'm very impressed with this little device, and would unreservedly recommend it for any home user.",electronics

I put a blanket on top of it and my dog's bone so she'd know it was hers. Now, three days later, she is in love with it! I can tell she's very comfortable on it as she is not constantly getting up and turning around trying to find a new position.

B000063W95,3/3,1.0,"I bought this printer new, when it was HPs top of the line. I have been very disappointed in it from day one.The print quality is fine. The duplexer is a joke. It needs the bottom of the page to grip the paper, so it can not print on that area. The driver software gives you two options to deal with this - print everything at about 90% scale to squeeze the content into the printable space, or re-sort the pages allowing the SW to move the page breaks. Neither is appealing, so I found that I reverted to manual duplex mode - taking the paper out and reversing itself myself.The biggest problem I have with the printer is frequent paper jams. Even when using HP brand multipurpose paper, I find that the printer jams about 25% of the time. In the quest for speed, the paper load mechanism is just too fast, pulling in many sheets of paper instead of just one.",electronics
B000MQJ19S,0/0,3.0,"I really want to like this product. And for the most part I do. However, it has its flaws.Pros: Very simple user-interface. Controls are intuitive (although some advanced actions can take some sleuthing). Works with Rhapsody (main reason I bought it instead of a Zune or iPod). Sound quality is good. Very small, sleek, and light-weight. Aesthetically pleasing.Cons: Doesn't play music while charging. A *big* minus. Also, the battery life is very mediocre. Plays for 4-5 continuous hours on a 1.5 hour full charge. The power seems to completely deplete over night (even when turned off); I have to charge it in the morning before I can use it (irritating). Uses a proprietary cable that costs $ to replace.In a nutshell: Sleek music player at competitive price. However, you get what you pay for.

B0001YXWVO,1/1,2.0,"Many positive reviews seem to indicate that this charger works handsomely for some folks and some laptops. It did not, however, work for me or my 12"" Aluminum Powerbook G4. Prior to purchase I visited the MacAlly website and found this line regarding compatibility:""AC adaptor works with G3 iBook and G4 PowerBook only""I assumed that my PowerBook G4 would fit under the definition of a ""G4 PowerBook"" and proceeded with my purchase. The adapter arrived quickly and smartly packaged, but when connected it would continuously cycle between charging and not charging or connected and disconnected. This seemed to be the case even when the laptop was powered off, but was particularly apparent when the laptop was running as it would cycle between full and 3/4 screen brightness and the charge indicator would bounce between ""charging"" and ""calculating (ie running from battery) status. When I contacted MacAlly via email about this I received this marginally helpful response:---------------------------------------Dear Customer,Thank you for contacting us.If the adapter you purchased does not have a blue LED light on the white Brickbox, it may have charging problem with 12"" PowerBook G4.Please return to your vendor and buy another brand charger for 12"" Powerbook G4 if this is possible.Sincerely,Michael Huang, Tech SupportMacally USA4601 E.

B0000630MK,4/23,5.0,I exclusively buy Sony Electronics because in my opinion they are the best. When I bought this Camera I knew that the quality would be there because it is a Sony. The camera works well except it is a little bulky. I primarily use this camera to film my son playing in the little league and it works well at capturing high speed action. It also is somewhat impact resistant because at his last little league game the umpire claimed my son was out when he was safe. Everyone knew that except for the umpire himself. I hit that fat porker right in the face with the camera (while it was on) and it captured everything - the picture quality was amazing and the sound was crystal clear. That fat slob hit the floor like a ton of bricks and was out cold. A couple of weeks later I got a letter from his lawyer and I had to appear in court because he filed a lawsuit against me. I showed the judge the tape of my son being safe and even he commented on the quality of the sound and picture and said my son was not out either. The judge dropped the charges all because of this great little camera.,electronics

Well, he wound up having to use it for the entire 7 days and found that it was the most supportive, best quality twin air mattress he's ever used. This is from someone who has rods in his back and finds it difficult to even sleep on hotel beds due to problems with comfort so this is very high praise for an air mattress.

B000MQJ19S,3/3,4.0,"I bought this player almost 2 months ago and I love it. I bought a wall charger and a protective case at the same time, so I've had no trouble with fingerprints or charging. The charge holds very well (I haven't tried charging from the PC, I prefer the wall charger) I use Windows Media Player 11 to manage my music files, and I've had absolutely no trouble syncing files, just a matter of choosing the songs and they sync in seconds. I did not use the CD that came with the player, so I can't comment on the content, instead I went to the Sandisk website and downloaded the user's manual in PDF format, which is pretty straightforward. (BTW, it also explains that some USB ports may not have enough power to charge the player, this may be why some customers are having trouble)Downloading photos was also very easy, again using WMP 11. I also downloaded video that I took with a digital camera.So far I haven't had any freezes like those described by other customers (I would suggest going to Sandisk's website and updating the firmware) I don't give the product 5 stars because if I'm listening to songs and then go to photos or the radio, when I go back to songs, they want to start again from song#1 instead of where I left it, which I find annoying. Also, I didn't like the earbud style (replaced them with Sony) and the fact that it didn't come with a wall charger, I had to buy it separately (but most players don't come with the charger these days). However the modulary style of the charger means that I got an extra sync cable, which is nice because the plug is propietary (another thing I don't like)Overall, I'm very happy with the View. Nice display, easy to use menu, great battery life, good sound, nice slim size, memory card slot,good radio reception, voice recorder, power saver features, syncs trouble-free with WMP 11.

B000063W93,58/59,4.0,"The good: Compact, easy to carry, lots of good features (too many to list; read the specifications), excellent playback picture, works great with my iMac, excellent sound reproduction, and straightforward instructions.The bad (kind of): Yes, in an absolutely silent environment you can hear the motor running, but in our first two hours of taping there was only one time, and that was only for less than a minute, where you could hear the motor running. So, I wouldn't call that bad because there is usually enough ambient noise to cancel it out. The wide angle isn't very wide angle, but you do get a lot of great non-digital zoom. The digital zoom gets pixelated pretty quickly but would you expect otherwise? You can only access some of the features with the viewing screen open and in bright outside light the picture is washed out and you can't really see the menus very easily. The fade in and out features were fun but somewhat cumbersome to use.The ugly: Do not buy this camera if you intend on using it to take still pictures to the MMC. There are two problems. Check out the specifications and you will see that the CCD chip has only about 250,000 or so effective pixels. But, the real killer is the 8-bit color. There are two resolution modes, fine and normal. The instruction manual says the fine mode can be used for taking pictures for printing out and the normal for sending over the Internet. In the fine mode, a perfectly blue sky comes out mottled shades of blue, pink, and purple. For other, less uniform colors, the effect is worse. With the low number of pixels and 8-bit color, this feature is pretty much useless if you are used to using a good film SLR camera or a high pixel digital camera.Overall: I gave it four stars because it's a really good minicam with great Canon optics, many useful features, and ease of use, but I was really disappointed with the still picture feature. I can't believe Canon would even include such a poor quality feature. If you want both good digital video and pictures, you probably need to look at different brands with megapixel CCDs, which are available for a comparable price.",electronics
B000063W8P,4/5,4.0,"This product deserves a 5 star review. The tripod itself is very sturdy, supports a wide range of heights (including its lowest height which works nicely for macro shots), and it is light and compact (which makes it great for travel). Top that off with a great price, and you've got a great tripod. Here's why I gave it 4 stars:The product's accessory list is categorized incorrectly on Sony's website. If you look up the Cybershot DSC-N2, and click on it's supported accessory list, the VCT-D680RM Remote Control Tripod is listed (currently, as of writing this review). Furthermore, if you open Sony's description for the VCT-D680RM Remote Control Tripod, it directly lists the DSC-N2 as compatible.Note that the DSC-N2 is only HALF compatible. It will fit just fine on the tripod itself, but it will NOT work with the remote control features. The DSC-N2 doesn't have an ACC jack, which is necessary to make use of the tripod's remote control features on a digital camera. I've called up Sony and discussed the problem, and they agree that the product is mislabeled. They've been very helpful as far as customer service goes, considering the fact that I didn't purchase the tripod directly from them. They even offered a full refund on the product directly from them. Hopefully they'll update their website soon so this doesn't confuse anyone else.This is why I'm giving the tripod a 4 star review. The tripod itself is great, but the documentation is incorrect. On that note, this is still an excellent choice for a tripod. If you're willing to spend more money, you can upgrade to the VCT-1500L tripod, which will give you an extra 2 inches on the high and low end of the tripod, but I found that the VCT-D680RM gives me plenty of flexibility and travel accessibility, and saved me some money. Even without the use of the VCT-D680RM's remote control features, it's still an excellent tripod, especially at Amazon's price.",electronics

A battery like this has advantages and disadvantages. It is small and flat, so a camera using this battery can be compact and slim. On the other hand you can't just run into any convenience store and buy a replacement like you could for AA batteries. Since a replacement might be hard to find on short notice, I think a spare is a necessity. Both the original and the one I bought from Amazon work great. They last a long time before they need to be recharged. The only problem I have with the battery is that it was very expensive. I haven't tried any cheaper batteries from other companies to see how their performance compares, but if I were to buy another battery for the SD870 I'd try a cheaper copy.",electronics

B000HBILB2,0/0,4.0,"I purchased this air mattress for use when we have a full-house of guests. It received a lot of use during a seven-day period around this past Christmas. Because of space limitations, it was necessary to inflate the mattress each night and deflate it the following morning. (However, it was only folded in half to get it out of the way. We did not fold it into a small square that will fit into the storage bag.) TheIntex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed with Built-in Electric Pumpperformed to our satisfaction. No burst seams nor slow deflation during the night (as others have reported). Our guest (a teen) said that it was fairly comfortable. I had tried this air mattress immediately after purchasing it, and found that it was tolerable. Of course, I'm considerably older (and less flexible) than my teen guest.The unanswered question is: How long will this mattress last before it springs a leak? Since I use this mattress very infrequently, I may not have an answer until next Christmas. My expectation, based on my experience with another air mattress (that carried an ""Eddie Bauer"" label), is that this mattress might be good for three or four ""seasons"" before it's kaput.Like other reviewers, I had performed due diligence (both on the Amazon site as well as other sites) before purchasing an air mattress.

The only issue I had was not being able to get 100% of the air out of it during deflation. We used the motor to remove most of the air, but towards the end it couldn't force the rest out.

B000MQJ19S,2/2,5.0,"I bought my Sansa View because I travel a lot, and wanted something to watch videos on during long flights. The Sansa View is perfect for this -- the battery lasts for 6-7 hours watching videos, AND, unlike a lot of other portable media players, it can keep playing while recharging -- so you can use its computer cable to hook it to a USB battery extender (a gizmo that takes 4 AA batteries and provides the same power output as a computer's USB port) and keep using it even longer!You can watch long (more than 40 minutes) video files on it without problems -- and it even allows you to bookmark your place in a video so you can restart from the same place later!With the newest firmware, video playback is excellent -- the audio and video sync up fine, and it has only frozen once the entire time I've owned it (and I use mine a *lot*). Earlier firmware versions may have had some problems in those areas, but those problems are fixed now -- which is why you should install the firmware upgrades from the manufacturer's website as soon as you get your new player!The player can connect to the computer as a ""mass storage device"" (like a USB thumb drive), so you can just drag and drop audio and video files onto it without using any special programs. It comes with free ""Sandisk Media Converter"" software for converting video files into a format the player can handle -- I wasn't very happy with the results, but there are plenty of other free programs out there for converting video files, so you can use a different program to convert the videos if you want to.Say goodbye to boring in-flight movies, this little gizmo is a traveler's best friend!

B0000DFZ67,357/376,4.0,"I purchased this mp3 player just last night after doing some scouting around.Here's a basic run-down from what I learned:Flash card memory vs. Hard Drive ( i.e. Why does a 256 mb player cost $$$...and a 40 GB (40,000 mb) player only cost $...?)mp3 players have either flash card memory or a hard drive in them. The flash card memory is more expensive but is very light and compact. That's why you have these things that can be keychain size. Tiny! mp3 players of this kind of memory are typically small and light and have between 64 mb - 1.5 GB of memory. I am averaging 4.5 mb per song, to give you an idea of how many songs you can get by the amount of memory. (1 GB = 1,000 mb)Hard drives (this is what most iPods have - and just about all mp3 players over 3-5 GB of memory). Cheaper to produce, holds a lot, heavier and has moving parts which means it's a little more prone to damage from being banged around. That said, they are pretty sturdy machines and I wouldn't let this dissuade you from getting an mp3 with a lot of memory. Just be aware of it.This explains why you see what appears to be such weird pricing on mp3 players. A 256 mb player (roughly 60 songs for me) is about X amount of dollars But a 30 GB (30,000 mb) player (roughly 6,650 songs) sells for only slightly more. It's because the 256 player uses flash memory (smaller/lighter) and the 30GB uses a hard drive. That's the first thing to understand. So consider what you're going to use the device for. If you're a jogger and you want to strap it to your arm, I'd recommend flash memory. If you want to listen to tunes while you travel, I'd get a hard drive because you can put so much on the thing - including audio books.REVIEW OF ZEN XTRA - 40GBThe device is larger than an iPod of similar capacity. This didn't bother me too much because it's still a decent size. It comes with a good case that fits it snuggly. The front cover (which you remove to take out the battery) feels flimsy but when snapped on, the device still feels pretty solid. As some other reviewers noted, after it was connected to the computer for a bit, it somehow stopped reading the player so I had to replug it. It did not lock up my computer or require a reboot. The software lets you pop in a CD and then scans the internet to name the artist, track name and album name. Extremely convenient. Then it rips the tunes into mp3s and puts them on your computer. You can even skip that step and rip them directly from the cd to the player. (won't leave copy on your computer.)The pros and cons of it: Great price. The iPod costs more for the same amount of memory. I thought the software was decent enough - it wasn't complicated to learn at all. The scroll button is sort of annoying to push - a nice button would be nicer but eh, not a big deal. It also stores data so I can see myself placing some data files on here.It is slightly larger than an iPod, no doubt about it. For me, that was the only drawback. I'm really happy with this purchase. Also, when I installed the software, it said that Windows XP hadn't approved something with the drivers, etc - and that continuing it install may cause instability. If you're like me, that will definitely make you pause. After I reviewed the manual (a pdf file included on the cd), I felt better because they warned you about the message and said it wouldn't cause problems and, in fact, it hasn't. So if you have XP, be prepared for this and don't be alarmed.If you are out for an mp3 player with a lot of memory and do not want to spend a ton of money, I think this is a great purchase and strongly recommend it. I would have liked to have given it 4 1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size.",electronics

Simple to operate hardware and software. There is only one button on the device.

Cons: 1. It takes too long for for radio station data to appear on the web site. They say 24 hours, but I've currently got stuff out there longer than that that I'm still waiting on. 2. Large device for a keychain. Considering the hardware is just a time/date stamp, it should be smaller. 3. The device only stores 10 songs, and there is no way to delete entries without uploading them on your computer. 4. Sony has gone through too much effort to make the website cool, and not enough effort in making it fast.

B000MQJ19S,0/1,1.0,"This player was great...in the beginning. I'm not an active user of MP3 players, and only use them on road trips to avoid carting a bunch of CDs along with me, which happens a few times a year. After the first year of owning this player, the scroll wheel decided it didn't want to work properly anymore. Keep in mind that the only way to move through menu selections is with the scroll wheel, and when one day it decided not to work properly, it made it very difficult to scroll to any selection. It just bounces back and forth on the menu when scrolling in any direction. For instance, if I was scrolling down, it runs upward and downward on the menu in a frantic manner; and vice versa. It's very frustrating to actually land on a desired menu item and has caused me to write this player off as a disposable hunk of junk. I would not recommend any SanDisk player that uses a scrolling wheel to anybody, and would specifically advise you to not purchase this item. However, since I don't use the video features of this product, I'm going to purchase the Sansa 8MB clip and try again: it doesn't have a scroll wheel, and I've heard great things about it, so I'll keep my fingers crossed...",electronics

It's a cool little mp3 player and, when it works, the sound quality is great, the screen is very sharp, and it has an appealing and easy to use interface.However it just doesn't work. Some may remember this player was originally billed as the ""Rhapsody"" player by Sandisk. It never, ever worked with Rhapsody, and Sandisk never acknowledged the problem or offered a solution, a total abdication of corporate resposibility to their clients. After numerous hours dowloading firmware, and re-booting, re-setting and returning to the store and trying again, I finally had to accept that this player, although a hugely appealing concept with great potential, would never work. I now have a very expensive, ($140 + tax) portable fm radio, which I really love by the way.Sandisk's solution to this tale of woe, was to simply drop the ""Rhapsody player"" from the name and continue selling. If you do any research at all, you will find the message boards filled with countless clients complaining of the same difficulties: freezin up, an endless dowload indicator which never dowloads anything, an indication that the dowload is complete only to find that no content can be found on the player, etc. You may also find that not only Rhapsody users but regular mp3 users had similar trouble, I never did because I was not interested in using this as a regular mp3 player, so I never tried.

Are your designers living in the 70s or do they just have their heads up their butts?""""I havent had a TV remote in my hand without a last channel button in at LEAST 20 years. Since the remote is so huge, how could it not have one of the most traditional buttons on it? I consider the very lowest and feature-less remotes to be those in hotel rooms. They look like top-of-the-line models when compared to this piece of crap.On top of not having the basic buttons, and amongst other issues, the remote is frustrating because: 1. The text is illegible, 2. The buttons are laid out in a way that doesnt make sense and 3. When you channel surf, the remote is so slow to change the channel that you want to throw it on the floor and stomp on it. In fact, if I can find a universal remote that works with this TV; I intend to do just that. Of course, to add insult to injury, it states clearly in your owners manual that 'We do not recommend the use ofuniversal remote controls. Not all of the functions may be controlledwith a universal remote control.' Great, so you provide a bottom of thebarrel remote with your TV, but then dont allow your customers to get adecent remote by making your TV uncooperative with them. This is thefirst time that I have encountered this too, BTW.""Finally:""I hope that you promptly change the remote that comes with the 6620LDG LCD TV/DVD combo TV. I expect that you will experience many returns of this product due to the crappy remote that comes with it.""THIS was their entire response:""Thank you for taking the time to express your concerns regarding our product.

I love that they are higher than some inflatable beds, so you don't feel like you are just sleeping on an air mattress. The slight incline to the head area is great and keeps your pillow from falling off. Also, the top is flocked to prevent your sheets from feeling slippery and you don't feel like you are sleeping on plastic. I slept on one of them twice myself and found it to be very comfortable. You can control the amount of air to make it firmer or softer. They inflate/deflate very fast! I always think that inflatable beds are cold, so to prevent this I use an electric mattress pad on them. These beds come with a travel bag, so you can travel with one and prevent it from getting damaged. I think these are a very good product, especially for the price!",electronics

B000MQJ19S,3/3,4.0,"I've had my Sansa player for four days now, and am really enjoying it.I previously owned a 4GB Sony Walkman, but the Sony isn't compatible with [...] audiobook file format, so when the time came to upgrade my player, I opted for the 8GB Sansa View.It has some pluses and minuses compared to the Sony Walkman.For one thing, it's about 25% larger, and noticably heavier than the Walkman.And I don't find the Sansa's user interface as easy to navigate as the Sony Walkman.(In particular, the lack of a physical volume control switch is a bit off-putting, and the UI volume control isn't intuitive).On the Sony Walkman, you can easily control the volume with an Up/Down rocker-style switch, and skip through tracks on the player by pressing the back or forward arrow buttons.On the Sansa, you have to use a combination of pressing the arrow buttons and spinning the thumb wheel to navigate to a particular track or to control the volume, and you have to actually look at the screen while you're doing it, because of the multi-layer screens and options.Since I hook my MP3 player into my car stereo system for longer drives, this is a big usability issue for me. With the Sony, I didn't have to take my eyes off the road to adjust volume or move to the next file. With the Sansa, if something isn't adjusted correctly, I either have to pull over or wait until I hit a red traffic light.That being said, I really like this player. It has twice the storage capacity of my Walkman, and I like having the option to bump that up even further by inserting an extra memory chip. The file transfers when syncing the player are significantly faster than on the Sony, which encodes MP3 files in some way during the syncing process. For example, an audiobook file that took less than 40 seconds to transfer to the Sansa player took nearly an hour using Sony Media Manager.The sound quality is very nice, and the Audible file compatibility makes up for any annoyances in trying to navigate through the UI.",electronics
B000MQJ19S,1/2,2.0,"A new 8GB Sansa View, tested with the original firmware (don't remember what it was) and 01.01.06A. In both cases, repeatedly playing of 128kbps MP3 eats fully charged battery in 8 hours. No extra micro SD memory and no earphones (that is, no audio payload at all). I would understand if it played for 30 hours instead of 35. I would even understand 25 hours. At least, there would be some connection with the reality. But not 8. Not 4 (four!) times worse than claimed. Dear Sansisk, you are liers. Your reputation is getting down below the ground level.I don't believe it is a bug in the firmware, because when playing it noticeably warms up -- very slightly, but quite noticeably. It means the player consumes at least 1 watt of power -- just my rough estimation, but definitely not 0.1 watt. When it consumes 1 watt of power, the fully charged battery must keep at least 35 Watt/hour. In my laptop it's a 71 w/h extended battery and it's very heavy. Do you believe such a small thing like Sansa View can keep 35 w/h? I don't -- it simply impossible.I don't care much about this money and will keep using it mostly in my car, with the external power. I'm too busy and too lazy to send it back. But I want people to know: claimed 35 hours of 128kbps MP3 is bald cheating.

You do not need a spare battery unless you plan to leave your camera on for over 3 consecutive hours at a time(which means you have a photograph nazi obsession with taking pictures of everything that comes to view) or if you're faced with the situation that you have no way to recharge your original camera battery (which means you should be more worried about having no useable electricity than about keeping your camera going to document the occasion you were without a working power outlet or battery charger).The battery is a cute little 3d polygonal block. The price is like paying a bunch of money for one block instead of a whole box of Lego bricks.The back of the battery reads, ""Do not short-circuit, disassemble or expose the battery to fire or water."" Oh, no shiz, Sherlock!""Made in China"". Wonderful.",electronics
B0000DFZ67,5/5,5.0,"I just purchased this player and I have to say that I love it. The sound is excellent, the battery life is excellent, the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent, and finally the price, $200 cheaper than the 40gb Ipod, is excellent. The only thing the Ipod has over the Nomad is the style, size, and ease of use. The Nomad is not ugly, it is not that big, it comfortably fits in my pocet, or heavy, and the controls are not hard to get used to. So far I have no complaints and I recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance, also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing. I only have one question, when I add tracks to my Nomad, via Nomad Explorer, they are automatically put in alphebetical order, rather than album order. Is this possible to fix, if so how, if not does Notmad Explorer from Red Chair Software do this? I would like album order for my live albums and was just wondering. Thank you very much, and go out and get yourself a Nomad!",electronics
B0001YXWVO,4/4,4.0,"I went looking for an alternative to the stylish, cleverly designed, but expensive OE Apple powerbrick AC adapter when mine started showing signs of plug wear (flickering of the ring light at the connection to the computer). I had wanted one for a while anyway, so I could keep one at home and one at my office, thus shortening my daily packing-up time and (I hoped) prolonging the life of the equipment through fewer coiling/uncoiling cycles. I was pleased to find the MacAlly product, which cost less than half as much and appeared to fill the need. I read that its power output was slightly lower; frankly, I can't tell the difference. It charges my Powerbook G4 just fine. I miss the ring light on the plug keeping me apprised of charging progress (I now have to check the battery status indicator in the OSX taskbar) and it lacks the Apple adapter's ability to plug right into the wall, so most of the time I have more cord than I need.

Obviously, you do not expect an air mattress to compare to a real mattress. I have now used it a couple weeks in a row, and it seems to remain inflated at a consistent level. It is very convenient to have the air pump built in, and it does not impact comfort at all. Also, it has a compartment next to the pump to store the power cord.

B000N7613A,7/8,5.0,"First off, for those that claim it does not work in 1080i, 1080p, you need to set BOTH units to the proper configuration. These cables DO NOT AUTOMATICALLY do it for you. No HDMI cables on the market can do that. In many tv's and dvd players, the HighDefinition mode must be set manually and even when that's done, the highest setting can only be achieved if both of the units support that resolution. For example, my Samsung player defaults to 720p, I have to hold down a button on the remote for it to change to 1080i. Go to Crutchfiled.com for more details, they have a great article on HDMI.I agree like most people here this cable is the real deal. It's hard to believe it's selling for single digit dollars while simliar cables at the retail stores are asking for $40-$120 each.As there are several vendors selling this product, I'm reviewing the one from ClearAV. I bought 3 of them for less than $25 shipped. The cables that came from ClearAV are apparently made by Inspire as it's stamped on the connector. Cables are all black except where the Inspire logo is (blue-green). It's flexible as any normal cable. I've read where some cables are too stiff.Connection tests:I have a brand new Samsung 4665 Full HD 1080p 1920x1080 tv. I connected the HDMI cable to the Sony Playstation 3, they both automatically detected the capabilities of each unit and saw that it was set to 1080p mode. Blu-ray movies were excellent. DVD movies were automatically upscaled to 1080p when I put in an older movie of Saving Private Ryan and the newest Live Free or Die Hard. Audio was transmitted correctly as the TV detected the presence Dolby Digital signal.Second test was with the same TV, but with a different player, a Samsung DVD 1080i player. Connected a 2nd cable to it and the TV automatically detected 1080i. Audio was streamed over correctly as the display screen on the DVD player showed Dolby Digital 5.1. Sound was just like it was before when I used an optical cable. Of course now, the optical cable is no longer needed because of the HDMI cable.With the successful results of the video and audio tests, I can conclude that all digital video and audio signals were apparently streamed over successfully. They appear to meet the HDMI 1.3 specs. I would ABSOLUTELY buy 3 or 10 more of these when I get more HDMI components. What a DEAL!",electronics
B0000630MQ,169/170,5.0,"I need a fast, compact charger that could easily fit into my digital camera bag. Other chargers are compact, BUT the electric cord takes up a lot of room. This charger DOES NOT have an electric cord to contend with, Instead, it has a collapsable plug, which folds completely hidden into the unit when not in use, allowing it to be placed neatly into the camera bag pocket.With the storage issue taken care of, the performance of this unit is above expectations. The recharging process is less than 3 hours. Unlike other models, you can recharge either one, two three or all four batteries at once and still get a full charge on all batteries. The two battery option is nice for my kids walkie-talkie batteries. The shut down mode when complete is a nice option that is really needed, especially for the time when you forget about the charger until the next morning.I've tried several other chargers and this is the BEST model that I have worked with.

B0000DFZ67,21/21,5.0,"In April of 2004, I received a birthday present which happened to be the Zen Xtra 40 GB. I was thrilled, but also a bit hesitant. I have had numerous other mp3 players, ranging all the way back to the Rio 600. None of which really met what I considered to be a good player. They all had some flaws, but had some good points about them as well. The last creative product I owned was a Jukebox 3, which was flawed as well. The hard drive failed, and so I called their customer support (this was at least 2 years ago), and asked if they could repair it. They said that they could, so I sent it off. They send it back saying it wasn't repairable. So I went with my first instinct and replaced the harddrive, and then not 2 months later the headphone jack went dead. So it was all line-out for me after that, what a pain.So that brings me to the Zen Xtra, and I have to say that after some abuse, but also some TLC, that the Xtra has performed like a champ. I have had no problems whatsoever. Apparently, Creative fixed the headphone jack issue, because after switching between the home setup and the car setup at least twice/three times a day, it still performs flawlessly.I am now going to comment on some of the other user's issues.1. The battery life- I honestly have not had any problem with battery life, last time I checked and ran it dead at work one day while listening to it, It lasted 11.5 hours. (I wasn't at work the whole time, but I never stopped playback from when I got up, to around 7:30 that night.) This was listening to mostly VBR mp3s encoded with LAME with --alt preset standard, and some extreme.2. The headphone jack- As I said before, I have not had any problems with the headphone jack, as I have with the NJB3 headphone jack. (Which by the way I resoldered and fixed and then the whole unit broke, cheap parts?)3. The battery cover lid - Honestly, I leave mine in the leather (pleather?) case pretty much all the time, and this keeps the case from coming open. It also keeps the unit from getting scratched, so thats another plus. All I did was take a hobby knife, and cut away a screen (inbetween the layers of fake leather, there is a plastic screen layer, so I just left that, and cut a small square hole for the power plug. I usually never have to remove it.4. Its so much bigger/heavier/crappier than the Ipod - I have used Ipods before, and honestly, yes the xtra is thicker than the ipod, however, is less than .5 inches thickness worth losing the USER replaceable battery, and costing at least 100 dollars more ( I think it's more like 150-200, but I'll be generous). To me it was not worth that extra money. And to the guy that posted a link to a free ipod site, Uhh.. That sounds like a scam.5. Frequent Crashing - Mine has crashed maybe 5 times, out of everyday use, and when it froze, I unhooked the battery, and replaced it. After a few minutes of the library rebuilding, I was back to enjoying my music.This unit has literally worked flawlessly for me. The fact that it has multiple format options, It can also be used for external storage, which works nicely. I do not use the Creative software, I use Red Chair's Notmad Explorer, and do not have any problems.I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a good mp3 player, and an even better price.--Rob",electronics
B0009ZCTX2,40/40,5.0,"I purchased this monitor about two weeks ago and have been extremely impressed. No dead pixels, very bright screen (yet highly adjustable), and 8 ms (not 20 ms) response time is fast enough even to play games, though I bought the unit mostly to decrease eye strain when reading web content.Speaking of which ... I only use this display with ClearType. Anybody using an LCD should seriously consider ClearType, as it seems to improve readability of text. If you're an internet news junkie like me, you'll want as much clarity as possible.The onscreen menu is very simple and straightforward though you won't use it very often. It's the same system used on other Viewsonic monitors - two ""select"" buttons, two ""arrow"" buttons.The manual is minimalistic but covers what you need to know.The digital input provides an astoundingly crisp display! I also have it connected to an analog input from another system (you can switch between them) and the difference is noticeable, but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the analog input. And if you're switching from a tube-display, even the analog is a huge improvement.The built-in speakers are OK. They're nothing to write home about, and they can't handle much power, so don't plan on using them for music playback or even gaming audio. But if all you want is a simple ""noise maker"" for the occasional PC sounds, they work just fine. (They're only an inch tall... what do you expect?)Viewsonic's warranty is a full three years including the backlight. This was very important to me as I'm not about to attempt a backlight swap-out. (There are folks who've done it, but I won't be one of them.)I've owned Viewsonic monitors (home and work) for many years, and their quality is top-notch. They cost a little more, but provide excellent performance. I've had some models (tubes) in use for over 4 years without any problems.

However I found the exact same cable in an apple store called ""Thin Fire Wire"". The exact same cable (1.8 Meter 4 to 6 pin to be exact) for only $29 and it works just fine. So check out an apple store near you and save some money.Shame on you Sony.",electronics

B000063W94,1/1,4.0,"Had this over 10 years!! It is the best overall printer I've owned as far as durability/quality. The printer is too expensive now days even used. I paid $150 for this new 10 years ago. You can buy a cheap printer now days for less than $60!! OEM cartridges way too expensive for this printer. Only buy OEM cartrides, refilled ink quality BITES. I always buy expired cartridges now and that saves a lot of money. Great print(documents),not laser quality, but it did an above average job. Just bought another printer the other day for $20 and the documents printing is sharper than this printer. This printer rarely jams and if it does jam it is very easy to unjam. Envelopes jam more often. I dislike the ink low warning, it comes way too soon. In reality you have weeks of more printing. I usually wait until the printer will not print anymore, what a scam the low ink indicator!! I really do enjoy this printer especially now that I figured out expired ink works just as well and saves me tons of money. Picture detail is great, but falls short of professional quality even with the HP Premium Plus paper. The glossiness is good but is not even and it will smear. Needs to dry several seconds before touching. The worst thing I can't stand about this printer is, it doesn't have an automatic shutoff feature. This is the first printer I've owned without that feature, I can't begin to tell you how many times this printer has been left on.",electronics

B0000DFZ67,0/0,4.0,"I personally like the control that the Zen Xtra gives you in organizing and classifying your music. It also creates playlists on the go for you (combining tracks by the same Artist, the same album, or same genre) for easy playback retrieval.The software that it comes with, Creative MediaSource, is great also, however may be a little complicated for new computer users. It lets you edit all track information (Artist, genre, album, track #) regardless of what ID3 tags were used when recording.Also do I need to remind you of the removable battery. Poor iPod users have to shell out almost $100 to get their battery serviced/replaced when its dead. Also you can store, data files, video files, etc. on the Zen Xtra (it's a portable hard drive also)The only negative is the buttons on the case are oddly positioned.Overall I don't recommend this item for newbies.

B000063W94,1/1,5.0,"I have had this copier for 2 years purchased used. Anyone skeptical of HP products due to bad experiences with one of their PAVILLION desktops (as I have) should still be able to conceed that they make durable and economical printers. Printer ink for any of these older HP printers is relatively inexpensive and the cartridges last longer than DELL's or Epson's. If you are doing typical office printing, I recommend setting the default to DRAFT mode which is more than adequate for inter-office memos and records. It is darker than draft settings on most other brands, which are often faint, uneven, or illegible. This setting can extend the use of full cartridges to over 1000 pages. The printing is pretty fast at this setting as well. You can decide if draft mode is of suitable quality for clients and outside correspondence. If you still need a scanner/fax go ahead and get one, but leave the daily printing to this little workhorse & you will save money.I have used these deskjet printers (832c up to 990c) and they dont break down or have error issues. I don't recommend inkjets for photograghs because the ink is not waterproof, but the few times I have printed with heavy ink the image has been crisp and clean. They dont require much disk space for software either.If dinosaurs had been this indestructable they might still be around today.",electronics

Believe me I've had a lot of Boomboxes and I do a lot of research online when I'm looking for a product.I'm a musician and drive for a living. So I know when I hear a distorted bass or a weak kick drum sound which is the most difficult to produce in a small unit. And, I know how hard it is to keep that good sound when in a vehicle or when out side. I've had my share of ""Boomboxes"" . From $59 to $149 all bought at Wal-Mart, Bestbuys, etc. Not one had a sub woofer.This box has amazing sound. Sound quality that you can adjust like; separate bass and treble...Enhanced by a real 8 watt, 4 inch woofer you can select On or Off. A Loudness button you select On or Off. Anti-skip CD play back when in vehicles, etc, works great. LCD Display...very nice. Remote...love it. Buttons...nice touch and look.Basically give it the correct input of power and you'll get all of the two 5 watt and one 8 watt sub woofer output of sound. I think it's well made. Looks great. Size...a bit on the big side but, I've had all sizes. Users manual a little vague.I use a power inverter off of a 12v DC power point in my vehicle and house current at home. The 8 size D batteries are only good for short periods at low volumes.This box is power hungry. It's only as good as the power you feed it.I will probably buy one more for home use only.

B000MQJ19S,3/3,4.0,"I've had my Sansa player for four days now, and am really enjoying it.I previously owned a 4GB Sony Walkman, but the Sony isn't compatible with [...] audiobook file format, so when the time came to upgrade my player, I opted for the 8GB Sansa View.It has some pluses and minuses compared to the Sony Walkman.For one thing, it's about 25% larger, and noticably heavier than the Walkman.And I don't find the Sansa's user interface as easy to navigate as the Sony Walkman.(In particular, the lack of a physical volume control switch is a bit off-putting, and the UI volume control isn't intuitive).On the Sony Walkman, you can easily control the volume with an Up/Down rocker-style switch, and skip through tracks on the player by pressing the back or forward arrow buttons.On the Sansa, you have to use a combination of pressing the arrow buttons and spinning the thumb wheel to navigate to a particular track or to control the volume, and you have to actually look at the screen while you're doing it, because of the multi-layer screens and options.Since I hook my MP3 player into my car stereo system for longer drives, this is a big usability issue for me. With the Sony, I didn't have to take my eyes off the road to adjust volume or move to the next file. With the Sansa, if something isn't adjusted correctly, I either have to pull over or wait until I hit a red traffic light.That being said, I really like this player. It has twice the storage capacity of my Walkman, and I like having the option to bump that up even further by inserting an extra memory chip. The file transfers when syncing the player are significantly faster than on the Sony, which encodes MP3 files in some way during the syncing process. For example, an audiobook file that took less than 40 seconds to transfer to the Sansa player took nearly an hour using Sony Media Manager.The sound quality is very nice, and the Audible file compatibility makes up for any annoyances in trying to navigate through the UI.",electronics

B000063W8Z,55/55,4.0,"Pros:1) 18x Optical zoom. I can clearly see the faces of people sitting across an indoor stadium. Don't settle with 10x on many similar models!2) Size. Very comfortable and easy to hold for an hour, but heavy enough to prevent 'shaky hand', and not too small for big hand.3) Image stablization. It actually works, especially if the objects don't move a lot. Very important if you go near full optical zoom.4) Shooting modes. I tested both low light and spot light modes in a very low light indoor stadium. Spot light works like a charm, if you don't want to see the audience at all. Low light let you record everything, and the video is grainy yet acceptable. Overall, shooting modes work as advertised.Cons:1) Motor noise. The microphone picks up a LOT of motor noise, and this can become VERY annoying if you are recording in a quiet environment without a lot of background noise. Taping a sleeping baby in a quiet bedroom? forget about it.2) Color. The color often looks 'untrue', especially outdoor under stronger sunlight.

B0000630MI,96/101,4.0,"Usually anyone purchasing a combination DVD/VCR player has particular criteria they are meeting in order to get both forms of video into their television. Space, convenience, budget among other reasons comes to mind. That aside, looking at an actual unit the person is most likely more interested about the VCR. DVD reproduction at this level looks so good that it is almost a given fact that it will perform up to someone's expectations. The VCR is another matter. For my own needs I am concerned about the playback of pre-recorded tapes and playback of home VHS recordings that I made. How the DVD/VCR player records in VHS is also important but to a lesser degree. JVC brand VCRs are an interesting and confusing animal when it comes to playback of tapes. I own two JVC S-VHS recorders with flying erase heads. I also own several SONY and older RCA VCRs from the good old days. The problem with JVC is that they play certain tapes back beautifully and others dreadfully. I took several samples of video tape recordings and demonstrated playback on this unit just to see for myself. (I know salesmen at a local electronics store in the area and they always let me try out equipment. They just love low-end technology guys like me.) Pre-recorded movies looked acceptable and I really mean no better than acceptable. Recordings I made on my JVC units in SP and EP modes looked excellent on this unit. Recordings I made on my other SONY units in the SP mode look very good. RCA recordings in SP look average. Recordings I made on my other SONY units in the EP mode looked horrible. They looked like blurred images without any trace of definition. Recordings I made on my other RCA units in LP and EP modes again looked blurred without any trace of definition. However, I made an actual recording on this unit from a satellite broadcast and the playback looked excellent. The bottom line on this unit is that the DVD side looked very good and the VCR performed just about the same as my stand-alone units which I own. There were really no surprises. When I make recordings at home I indicate which VCR the recording was made on just for the very reasons I mentioned above. After many years I have found that a recording usually looks best when played back on the unit it was made from. The reality today is that VHS is an outdated but necessary technology because many of us have a monetary and/or sentimental investment in tape recordings. I think this JVC unit is good but I rate it based upon how I would be using it relative to my library of VHS recordings and how they are going to look.",electronics
B0001YXWVO,0/0,1.0,"I decided to give this a try after taking a look at the Apple price for their replacement (averaging $80, s/h NOT included). The reviews helped ease my mind about using another party replacement for the adapter as well, and for the 1st few months everything seemed ok,although I kind of wished the connection seemed more secure. Unfortunately, in the past 2-3 months or so, I'd noticed the somewhat 'loose' fit of the plug had gotten worse, so much so that just adjusting the laptop on my legs would mean it often falls out. At this point, now I have to keep checking the connection to make sure it's still inside the Mac. I'll glance up at the battery indicator and won't see the charging icon, but rather that my battery's being used for God only knows how long. Then I'll have to press the plug back in again. I took the Macally adapter out one day to look at it closely and discovered what the real issue is: the thin metal ring around the 'male' charging piece has a slight split/bend in it, which means it isn't fitting snugly in the Mac's charging portal. I don't know how long this has been there. I'm pretty careful w/ my Mac stuff, so I'm relatively sure it wasn't damaged from being wound up in my laptop case and I *know* I wouldn't be jamming the thing into this expensive hardware, so I'm at a loss. I only know it never really fit in the charge slot correctly from word-go and now it's just barely staying in long enough to keep the charge unless I'm absolutely still. I'm really disappointed in this. I'm hoping to get it replaced under the mfgr warranty. If not, I'm certain not to repeat my mistake by purchasing another Macally adapter.

It had been working just fine, until few days ago I was playing a DVD and all of a sudden it would freeze, and on the TV screen there would be many different colored squares, completely distorting the image. And now, the Dvd player does not even recognize any format (I've tried CDs, DVDs, and even VCDs), as it only says &quot;Incorrect Disc&quot;.I just now found another review where the person had the same problem, had to take it to a local service center, got fixed, came back, and the exact same problem popped back up three weeks later.Reading that, I don't even know if I want to even bother taking it to get it fixed.

B0009EK9XA,5/9,2.0,"I bought my unit in July, 05. Installation and configuring the unit took ALL DAY, with at least 4 hours on the phone with HP support (including working with senior support folks) just to get it functioning at a basic level. From the beginning I experienced problems. A few of the more serious ones are listed below:1) television picture quality with my older Sony Trinitron is terrible. The support person working to help me configure the unit eventually simply said, ""well, it is a DIGITAL entertainment center,"" when we couldn't get the picture right. Given that I have digital satellite service and the set top box provided by the satellite provider gives me a crystal clear picture on my TV before I hooked up the DEC, I was not pleased by this response. If the satellite tuner get give me a good picture, I can't see why the DEC couldn't as well. It comes with MULTIPLE tuners - none, apparently for an analog TV monitor.2) The unit is supposed to work like a TIVO for recording broadcast programs, and allow you to do things like pause a live broadcast to answer the phone or get a snack. Well, on my unit, pausing causes the program to freeze, skip and otherwise freak out. The only cure is to turn the unit off and restart. Of course, I don't use the pause feature any more.3) For music, this unit comes with iTunes, and also a way to list, play and organize your music that has been imported into iTunes on they're Media Center. Importing my CD's into iTunes worked perfectly well. When I view the ""my music"" selection in the media center, my individual albums are duplicated, with the play lists segmented among the duplicated listings. So for a given CD with 12 songs, there will be two or three entries for the CD, with one or two songs with one entry and the rest of the CD on the other.4) Making playlists on My Music is an important feature for me. I find that while I was able to make a couple of playlists when the unit was new, I no longer can. Its not clear why, but, it is another frustration.These are just a sample of the issues. Calling HP support, which I have had to do MANY times, is an uneven experience. Often the help is good. However, they have not been able to resolve the issues I've listed above. The complexity of the product and the issues with design and testing I'm seeing means that problems that you have with it are also complex, with many layers of related issues. Solving these kinds of problems over the phone (your only option) is extremely frustrating and often doesn't solve the problem.Given the price of the unit and given that what this product does is to combine technology offered in the past as different products (that is, it contains proven technology) the problems I've encounted are inexcusable. This product was not ready to be put on the market. I would return the z555 and get my money back if I could. Knowing what I know now, instead of buying the DEC, I would get a Tivo and a good iPod with accessories to play my music off of my home stereo instead and save myself a ton of money and frustration.As it is, I just feel ""taken"" by HP and my DEC is NOT working now. $2000.00 down the drain.",electronics

I then printed some wallet size pictures of my son from his school picture they also came out wonderful. I am very pleased with this printer.

B0000630MI,96/101,4.0,"Usually anyone purchasing a combination DVD/VCR player has particular criteria they are meeting in order to get both forms of video into their television. Space, convenience, budget among other reasons comes to mind. That aside, looking at an actual unit the person is most likely more interested about the VCR. DVD reproduction at this level looks so good that it is almost a given fact that it will perform up to someone's expectations. The VCR is another matter. For my own needs I am concerned about the playback of pre-recorded tapes and playback of home VHS recordings that I made. How the DVD/VCR player records in VHS is also important but to a lesser degree. JVC brand VCRs are an interesting and confusing animal when it comes to playback of tapes. I own two JVC S-VHS recorders with flying erase heads. I also own several SONY and older RCA VCRs from the good old days. The problem with JVC is that they play certain tapes back beautifully and others dreadfully. I took several samples of video tape recordings and demonstrated playback on this unit just to see for myself. (I know salesmen at a local electronics store in the area and they always let me try out equipment. They just love low-end technology guys like me.) Pre-recorded movies looked acceptable and I really mean no better than acceptable. Recordings I made on my JVC units in SP and EP modes looked excellent on this unit. Recordings I made on my other SONY units in the SP mode look very good. RCA recordings in SP look average. Recordings I made on my other SONY units in the EP mode looked horrible. They looked like blurred images without any trace of definition. Recordings I made on my other RCA units in LP and EP modes again looked blurred without any trace of definition. However, I made an actual recording on this unit from a satellite broadcast and the playback looked excellent. The bottom line on this unit is that the DVD side looked very good and the VCR performed just about the same as my stand-alone units which I own. There were really no surprises. When I make recordings at home I indicate which VCR the recording was made on just for the very reasons I mentioned above. After many years I have found that a recording usually looks best when played back on the unit it was made from. The reality today is that VHS is an outdated but necessary technology because many of us have a monetary and/or sentimental investment in tape recordings. I think this JVC unit is good but I rate it based upon how I would be using it relative to my library of VHS recordings and how they are going to look.",electronics
B000MQJ19S,2/2,2.0,"I was a latecomer to the MP3 scene but I finally gave in about a year and a half ago when I picked up the Sandisk Sansa 8gb. The thing was a headache right out of the box. The software was useless. I couldn't for the life of me get it to work without crashing or freezing my Sansa. I gave up on that and went with the drag and drop method which was much simpler and faster and, for the most part, that worked fine.However I quickly discovered that if I wanted to add videos and photos to my Sansa, I HAD to use the software. If you drag and drop videos or photos, they won't be viewable. It makes absolutely no sense, but I gave the software another shot with no luck. I finally emailed customer support and they pointed me to a download of an older version of the software and, YAY! It worked! And about 5 minutes later it stopped working. My Sansa started sporadically disconnecting and reconnecting, interrupting the transfer and forcing me to restart the process again. Extremely frustrating.All that said, if you can deal with the frustration, the Sansa performs FAIRLY well.. I had a handful of incidents where the unit would just freeze up for no apparent reason and the delay when deleting a file or making play lists, for example, was horrid and made the features not even worth using unless you didn't mind wasting copious amounts of time.But when it wasn't lagging or crashing, it worked fine. It was a nice, small size and fit into my pocket without being noticeable. The wheel and buttons were responsive and worked well, for the most part. Though I was constantly annoyed at the inability to easily browse through my music the way I want to. I tend to arrange my folders in such a way that I can easily find what I'm looking for, and with the Sansa there is no option to just browse the hard drive and folder structure. It's very limited and close-minded, considering how easy it would be to add such a feature.I now own a far superior (and far more expensive) Archos 5 160gb and though it's bigger, it is a beautiful piece of electronic goodness.

B000063W90,3/3,1.0,"My HP DeskJet 870cxi died last month, and I replaced it with the Photosmart 1115, which I wanted to use with a Dell desktop (XP Pro) and an Apple iBook (OS 10.2.1).The only nice thing I can say about this printer is that it prints beautiful photos on photo paper. Printing anything else is a lesson in frustration.Printing a color web page with this printer is SLOW...it seems much slower than my old DeskJet. Second, I get frequent paper jams when printing on plain paper, and especially when printing envelopes. The printer jams when printing photos on 6 x 4.5"" photo paper that came with it. When I print documents on plain paper, I also occasionally get these cryptic error codes, and my document stops printing halfway through the job, leaving the paper stuck in the printer.The printer also comes with a CompactFlash and SD readers built in. It's pretty cool to insert a Compact Flash or Secure Digital card from a digital camera and print an index sheet right from the printer. However, my XP desktop won't recognize the cards from the printer. It says that there is no card inserted. Frequent e-mails to HP tech support have not been helpful - they say the card is faulty (it works fine in my camera and my Lexar card reader, however).Mac support is suprisingly lousy, because HP has been pretty good to the Mac in the past. I had to wait a month until HP released drivers for Mac OS 10.2.1 (Jaguar). The Mac drivers have the same problem the XP ones do: I can only print with the drivers; reading CF & SD cards with the printer doesn't work.I have had many HP printers in the past and have had no problems with them. I think HP struck out with this dud.",electronics

This air mattress did the job. It did a nice job of staying inflated throughout the week. My brother actually preferred the feel of it after a couple of nights (got slightly softer due to minimal air loss). The only issue I had was not being able to get 100% of the air out of it during deflation. We used the motor to remove most of the air, but towards the end it couldn't force the rest out. I tried pressure, but it seems as if the release has to be a certain angle to let the air escape. It still folded up and fit in the bag (barely). But overall, it held air and that's what we needed it to do.",electronics

Anyway, took this camera .... on a Disney cruise and impressed by the ease of use, wicked optical zoom, and awesome battery life (used the camera for 4 days (even for playback to watch the 30minute tape twice) and still able to video tape with no recharge.The things I did not like about the camera are:1) placement of fade button, and fact that I have to hold the fade, then stop recording (old Minolta 8mm used to fade when I stopped recording if fade on). Fade button only accessible with screen open, so if taping using eyepiece in bright outdoor light, then have to open screen (shaking camera of course) to get to fade.2) Either have to display date on tape all the time, or not record it on tape at all. Old camera used to have auto date time option that displayed the date and time for about 5 seconds on first recording of the day, and wouldn't display it again until day changed. Not so with this as far as I can figure.3) Eyepiece view kind of small. Have to use this in really bright sun when you can't see the LCD screen.This is discontinued and you can get it now for $$$ if you can find it.

B000HBILB2,2/2,1.0,"I had a twin size Aerobed mattress for several years and I was very happy with it. When it finally developed a leak, I went shopping for a replacement. I decided to try Intex rather than Aerobed because it is 5"" longer and I read complaints about recent models of Aerobeds having leaks. As usual, I read all of the Amazon reviews on this bed and I noted the complaints about leaks, but it seemed like a large majority of people were happy with it. I decided to give it a try since Amazon has a good return policy.When I got the bed, I had it inflated within 5 minutes of removing it from the box. The inflation process is very quick and easy and I found the bed to be comfortable. Unfortunately, when I came back an hour later, the bed was noticeably soft. It hit the inflation button and quickly the bed became firm again, but again, and hour later the bed was too soft to sleep on.Amazon is sending a replacement and I will update this review. If the second bed leaks, I will not try the Intex brand any more.Update: I received the replacement bed from Amazon within 3 days, great service! Fortunately, the replacement bed does not leak. It has been inflated for 3 days with no discernible loss of air. I should add that both beds have a strong chemical smell, but I assume this will dissipate in a couple of weeks. I am ultimately satisfied with my purchase, but I am leaving the rating low because it is a hassle to return the first bed and the manufacturer should have better quality controls.Update 2: The bed worked well for a little over a year, but now has developed a leak which requires air to be added every couple of hours. I am shopping for a replacement, but I do not think I will try an Intex product again.",electronics

B0000DFZ6L,0/0,1.0,"Apparently my boss doesn't read reviews. I requested a new scanner after my ancient Visioneer 9450 started eating paper for breakfast. I wanted a new brand and found one at a different website for a decent price. Instead, this one was ordered. I figured since it wasn't the same brand it would be better. Until I found it is a Visioneer. I thought perhaps since it was newer it'd be better. I was wrong. I use it for the ADF to scan hundreds of old files into digital files so we can get rid of the paper and reduce storage costs.The PaperPort software has OK settings, it allows you convert into a PDF, single page items, or multipage. The scanning quality is fine. The problems start when scanning. It seems to have trouble scanning one or two pages and randomly jams while it tries to feed the paper crooked. If you're scanning a large mutli-page file and it jams, you have to start the whole document scan over again. PaperPort FREEZES all the time. At first I thought it was neat that you could drag and drop pages onto one another to combine files, but it quickly lost its appeal when it started freezing and I'd have to force close it.The speed of which it scans is pretty poor, and it's FAR from quiet. The pin connector that plugs in the ADF is incredibly large so it doesn't fit in my oversized desk drawer like my previous scanner.I rarely hate devices as much as I hate this one.

The camera works well except it is a little bulky. I primarily use this camera to film my son playing in the little league and it works well at capturing high speed action. It also is somewhat impact resistant because at his last little league game the umpire claimed my son was out when he was safe. Everyone knew that except for the umpire himself. I hit that fat porker right in the face with the camera (while it was on) and it captured everything - the picture quality was amazing and the sound was crystal clear. That fat slob hit the floor like a ton of bricks and was out cold. A couple of weeks later I got a letter from his lawyer and I had to appear in court because he filed a lawsuit against me. I showed the judge the tape of my son being safe and even he commented on the quality of the sound and picture and said my son was not out either. The judge dropped the charges all because of this great little camera.,electronics
B0000630MN,8/8,4.0,"For years, I've seen combination pens with lights, but this lighted stylus is just the ticket for using your PDA in the dark, especially on Palm models with an unlit Graffiti panel.The Light Stylus comes with four interchangeable tops to fit a wide variety of PalmOS PDAs (the one I bought doesn't claim to fit PocketPC models.) One of them was a near-perfect match for my Palm i705 stylus, and in fact fit even better than the factory stylus in that it isn't as tight a fit. I did have some difficulty switching the top - there are no instructions - but a firm pull does the trick. There's even a reset pin under the top!The light is yellow and reasonably bright - good enough for use in the dark, though it's no flashlight. As a general-use stylus, it works well - the translucent plastic tip has a good writing feel. The only issue I have, and this is minor, is that sometimes you have to play with the rotation of the top to get the light to stay on, or off. Once you find the right position, though, it stays.Inexpensive enough to be an impulse-buy (as it was for me), the Saitek Light Stylus is a great idea at a great price.

One good thing, it is 40 Gb of disk space (well, it is 38 gb in reality). For the price and features it is really good. One thing, before buying this player I have called the Creative tech. support and asked them if I can navigate by folders beside artist/album and answer was Yes. Sure enough there is no such ability. Not sure, if customer rep. did not know the product exactly, it is still new or they just give an anser which users would like to hear. In any case, navigation by artist/album is ok however I miss an ability to navigate by folders. You even can not navigate by genre/artist/album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre, no other division. Creative is talking about updating it via firmware, however after following some while the descussion groups for Nomad players, looks like Creative represents mostly bug fixes in their firmware updates, not too much of new features. The software, which comes with player is not good at all. I did not managed to make Creative nomad explorer to work. After installing it and trying to make it working for 30 minutes I went and bought Notmad. Notmad worked right away after install and it is what I would like to see from the product. Transfer files is easy using Notmad, however again, would be great if Nomad supported folders like Iriver, RCA Lyra and some other. Often I fill I need to have better organization for the library and there is not enought of variables. Artist, album and Genre are only mp3 tags which are supported buy this player, and if you have 100 artists would be good to have another subcategory.

B000063W93,25/29,2.0,"Let me preface this review by saying that I really, really wanted to like this camcorder. I did a lot of research before buying this camcorder, including reading a lot of on-line reviews. Many reviews mentioned that the motor noise was picked up by the microphone and was audible on recordings. Some reviewers said it wasn't noticable. Well, against my better judgment I purchased this camcorder. Within the first 10 seconds of recording I could tell the motor noise was going to be a problem. Sure enough - it was quite annoying for me. I don't want to discount the other reviewers who said they didn't have a problem with the motor noise, but for me it was untolerable. I'm thinking that maybe some of the Canons might be louder than others, but the one I had was LOUD! I went out and payed the extra money for a Sony DCR-TRV18 (there is/was a ... rebate going so it wasn't too much more than the Canon) and it is MUCH quieter. It also seems a little better built, too.

B000C9KQJ4,1/1,3.0,"I originally wanted a Gates belt tensioner because I heard they were the best ones around. I found out Gates has a lifetime limited warranty on their products but it was up to the retailer to honor the Gates lifetime warranty. Napa wanted $50 dollars for the Gates tensioner with a lifetime limited warranty. I found cheaper retailers but I couldn't find a reliable retailer to honor the warranty. So I came to Amazon and went for the next best thing, a rebranded Gates tensioner with a 1 year warranty. How can I lose? Both this AC Delco and the Gates tensioner look identical and even share the same part number 38104. I waited patiently for this AC Delco tensioner to come in the mail. I was very elated when it finally arrived. I sliced through the little AC Delco sticker seal, opened up the white box, slid out the tensioner, lo and behold I was staring at a Gates tensioner, it even had Gates stamped on to the tensioner. The only thing that differentiate between this ""AC Delco"" tensioner I ordered and the Gates tensioner was the little sticker seal with AC Delco printed on it stuck onto the box. So now I have a Gates tensioner, I mean AC Delco tensioner with a one year warranty.The old tensioner was worn out and I could move the tensioner by hand, but I couldn't do it with the new one. There is no exposed parts on the new AC Delco/Gates tensioner, it uses a coil spring and not a flat spring as the cheaper tensioners use, made in Canada, nothing loose, didn't come with a new bolt but with a piece of paper that said to reuse the old bolt, plastic pulley just as the old one, a box to put the old tensioner in, and a 1 year warranty.I took off 1 star because it came out as a Gates anyways and I took off another star because oscillates a little by like 2 mm as the car is running. I expected it to be like a rock so I wonder if it has a dampener problems.

B000CIT2LS,2/3,3.0,"I purchased this kit to replace a rotted out muffler on our 1999 Cherokee. I was surpised to find an exhaust system for a good price, but incredibly lucky to also find a [...] through the manufacturer that cut the price in half!On to the kit.Installation was easy. The hardest part was getting the old rusty system off. A sawzall made quick work of it for the most part. The most difficult task was getting the slip joint at the back of the catalitic convertor apart.The pre-bent tail pipe fit very well. No issues with it contacting anything. It also has a nice polished tip. Nothing too fancy, just a nice polished tip.Sound wise, its similar to stock. I cant say that I notice it being any louder or deeper. I wasnt looking for that either, so I am very happy.Overall its a pretty nice kit. There are no real instructions that come with it, so its best if you are comfortable working with tools. Installation took me about an hour with the majority of the time spent removing the old parts.UPDATE: After a few months the polished tip did discolor. Its no longer a nice polished tip. Its not rusted, but not shiney either. Just an FYI. Revised my rating down to 3 stars because of this.",automotive

It works great with my camper, snow mobile trailer, ATV trailer and my old beater gravel, dirt and construction material trailer.Installation: If you have a 4 wire harness already installed (like I did) you can just plug into that for all the lights, blinkers and brake lights, then simply add a break controller for trailer breaking and connect to the wiring on the multi tow adapter. It also has pass through power connections for your attached trailer- which is great for charging your camper batteries while driving down the road.

B0002JMD8Q,1/2,1.0,"Upon looking at this Products and its reviews i thought, hey, here is a product that will leave the ""Car dealership Shine"" that everyone is looking for on my tires!!!! Well....Let me be the 1st real customer to review this product. I DO NOT work for this Du Pont company so i will be very honest. Let's start by stating any real man who cleans ALL the grease from his tires knows that they look horrible after they dry. They tend to turn a little brownish at times, so you need a good product to restore that ""Shine"". First time i used the tire shine, i was a dissapointed mainly for two reason:1. The trigger for the bottle was defective. i got more T.S. on my hands than i did on the tires!!!!!!!! Ridiculous!!!!2. The product DID NOT meet my expectations, after spraying it on a Pirelli Tire rubbed all the excess off still didnt look as shiny as other products i have used in the past.Now, the reason why i mentioned a specific brand of tires is because i detail cars. so..... i assumed it may have better results on a different tire, like Dunlop Goodyear.....NO!!!!!!!!!! i was wrong i tried on two more cars with negative results. I applied it to one of my top customers tires.....i had to do two coatings!!!!!!!!!! that means apply it twice. i was so dissapointed and upset. fortunately i had a back up plan. I had some Black Magic leftover i ended up using that. yea it slings off the tire when you drive but at least it HAD SOME DAMN SHINE TO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!So please new customers stay away from product, its horrible it's a shame, it did a better job moisturising my hands than it did providing a ""Wet"" look on the tires. and one more thing, i gave away the bottle it was 3/4 full, unlike many customers who give bad reviews and continue to use and buy the same item. i will never buy another item from Du Pont again!!!! well.... i know i will at some point. But never again that T.S..",automotive

B000NPIYDC,19/19,5.0,"The TIF combustible gas detector is outstanding!I'm a third generation HVAC installer and service technician. I've had one of these units for about 12 years now and it is every bit as accurate and reliable as the day I bought it.It is capable of measuring tiny gas leaks with astounding accuracy. The probe is flexible, which is extremely handy (and pretty much a necessity).I laughed when I saw this one on Amazon because it looks identical to the one I bought 12 years ago. I would have imagined they would have updated it. Then again, if something isn't broken why fix it?It is durable, easy to hear and holds a charge for a very long period of time. It is adjustable and can be set for small or large gas presence.For professional or DIY use this is the meter to buy.The only downside is the battery pack. They are not common and cannot be bought at your local hardware store. You'll have to buy them online. They cost around $20 for the battery pack. They last about 5-6 years with constant use.

He had the same truck as I, he was pulling a small boat with a trailer, I was pulling a 10,000 LB 5th wheel. He was so proud of his Edge Evolution Programmer he wanted me to come take a look at his. He was excited on how well it preformed and how easy it was to install. I have been thinking about that unsolicited endorsement ever since, especially when I began to lose power on slight inclines while pulling the trailer and when I buy diesel. After 2 years I finally bought one and couldn't be happier. I can now keep up with traffic while draging the trailer and I'm sure my economy has improved. I don't know by how much since I haven't gone through a whole tank yet with just pulling the trailer or a complete tank without pulling it.The installation was easy.

When it got frigid this winter, I would open the door, get in the van, close it up while I transferred out of the chair into the driver's seat, try to start the van and - you guessed it - not enough power left in the battery to turn the engine over. After the third time, I decided that I needed a new battery.I did some research and decided that an Optima Yellow Top Dual Purpose battery was just what I needed. Arrived *very* well packaged from Amazon, and even without charging it up, it ran through all of the non-starting actions and proceeded to start the engine in 10 weather.So far, I haven't had any problems whatsoever.

B000CFSE8I,0/0,4.0,"This review is based on three aspects of this product: Product Quality, Product Install & Product Performance.Product Quality: This is the third CAI system that I have installed. Compared to the other two, the quality is towards the top. The main reason that this product received 4 stars is the fact that the instructions were not 100% clear, and there was a transmission breather tube cap missing. Thankfully I was able to substitute for the missing piece.Product Install: The install was not hard if you are good with tools. The most challenging part was getting the intake tube through the stock front fender opening. It required some grinding and cutting of the inner fender to get the air intake through (another reason for the four star rating). If you do not like to alter anything stock, this is not the system for you.Performance: I did not notice any gains at lower RPMs, but you can feel a difference within the 1500 RPMs near the redline. If I was to estimate horsepower gains I would say 3-5 horsepower. The sound on the other hand, is pretty sweet.So, to sum it up, this is a great system that needs improved quality control when packaging, and better instructions. If you want to be able to put everything back to 100% stock, this system is not for you. If you want a little growl under the hood, and slight horsepower gains, add it to your cart.",automotive

I took it to my mechanic to have him check the headlight circuit and he told me that these are 100W bulbs. He said that the adapter that the bulbs plug into on my Mazda were slightly loose and it looks like the bulbs were arcing.

B0002LWEXI,7/8,5.0,"I've had my shade for about a month now. I bought it because the way I have to park my car at home it gets direct sun through the windshield from early afternoon till sunset. Besides, the fact that the car gets really hot, all that direct sun will fade my interior and dry out the vinyl.This one costs about twice what I'd have paid at Wal-Mart or PEPBOYS. But, this one was advertised as being cut to fit the windshield of my specific car, so I elected to get this one.I've bought the generic ""One size fits most windshields between xxx inches by xxx inches"" carried at the lower end stores and I was very unhappy with the fit. Either they are so large that when you try to put them in you have to fold the edges - or, they are too small and you have to use the visors to keep them from falling on the floor - or, they unfold into two circles that you have to cram into a rectangular windshield, resulting in huge gaps all over the place that let in a lot of sunlight and make the car hot despite their use.This one WAS cut the specific size for my vehicle (a 2006 Scion XB). It slipped right in place and stays tight in place without my having to pull the sun visors down to keep it from falling down. And, I don't have to kink it to make it small enough to fit.Also, and I realize this won't apply to a lot of you, I do a lot of out door photography, The inside of the shade seems to be a great hue to use as an outdoor light reflector when trying to balance the light in outdoor shots. I plan to use it when it gets a little warmer here and I shoot outside.

Also, it quieted the noisy lifters and made the engine much easier to turn over on very cold mornings.During the summers, I do use a viscosity-increasing additive [""NO SMOKE""] which I find to be better at reducing the engine's tendency to burn a little oil [quart every 2,000 miles], especially at high speed for sustained periods.

B000CQQKGU,2/11,2.0,"I bought this for use on my 2003 Toyota Tacoma PU, which came equipped with a hitch and is pre-wired for towing. So far, so good.The first thing that I noticed about this Reese 21794 ""ball mount"", is that it's TOO LONG! The one and only hole that is drilled in this item causes it to stick out from the hitch several inches. This means that the trailer wiring harness needs to be that much longer, as well. I don't find this to be true in all cases, and this extra length caused me to have to purchase a (3 foot!!) wiring harness extension at the last minute, in order to tow a borrowed trailer.The second annoying thing about this item is the rattle, caused by about a 1/16th inch tolerance between the Toyota receiver and the Reese product. Driving without a load on ANY trailer (I've tried 3 different ones, so far!) caused the ""ball mount"" to bounce up and down inside the receiver. I'm no towing veteran, but I don't see why Reese can't choke up the tolerance so that the ball mount can be easily slid into the receiver, yet not be so damn noisy!... and how about a SECOND hole, for those of us that don't care about the extra towing length, but DO care about the ability to use a standard/short wiring connection!",automotive

They don't lock in. What this means is that if you pull up on the cap and turn, there is a friction battle between where the spinning top contacts the base of the cap and the nubs against filler neck. Guess which has less friction... the nubs against the filler neck. For this design to work, the cap would need to spin on ball bearings, or something else that has less friction then the nubs against the filler neck.Bottom line: If you pull up on the locked cap with gentle to moderate force and turn the cap, it comes right off.

The manual is a small booklet full of the usual warnings, a step by step on proper jumper placement, and a table to calculate how long to leave a battery on the device. It is manual and will not shut itself off so you can damage a battery with this thing. Of course it is manual so you don't get the usual faulty responses either (I consider this a pro).Great no compromise charger!",automotive

I even wore clean, plastic gloves to prevent any accidental contact. After the first bulb burned out, the other one burned out within a week. Luckily, my order for another pair of bulbs had arrived. Amazon was running a great sale on these bulbs so I decided to give them another shot.

B0002JMD6S,0/0,4.0,"I recently upgraded to a car with leather seats and wanted to get a kit to clean and maintain them. After reading many product reviews and posts on forums, it seemed like many users recommended Tanner's Preserve. I purchased the Cleaner and the Conditioner separately because it was slightly cheaper than buying a kit. Last Saturday I tried both products.The cleaner was easy to apply and seems to work well. I began by vacuuming the interior. I used a thin cloth with the cleaner. I sprayed the cleaner onto the cloth and rubbed seats with it. The cloth showed dirt that was removed. The cleaner has very faint smell, and evaporates quickly leaving no residue or scent.Once all of the seats were cleaned, I applied the conditioner by hand. I did everything as the bottle directed: apply, wait five minutes, buff. It was a little challenging to apply because I have perforated leather seats and the conditioner goes quickly. The conditioner did not add any shine to seats. I like the smell of the conditioner; it made my car to smell like new leather, but not too strong.It is clear to me that I will be using more of the conditioner than of the cleaner, so once I run out, I will be buying the 6-pack of the conditioner.",automotive

Things to note are that this fuel cap is smaller than my stock cap in exterior dimensions so it fit with ease inside my fuel door, the other thing to note (as I'm sure you can see) is that this has no cord to hold it to the car, nor can one be added. This is what I miss most about my old fuel gap, instead of just letting this one hang you have to take it off and put it somewhere at the pump, although it hasn't happened to me I'm sure that some people will forget this cap at the pump because it's out of site when you're done filling.All in all, if you can get over not having a cord to hold it in place when the cap is off then this is a great replacement cap.Hope it helps!",automotive

When I finish one room I take the mop pad off and use the kitchen sprayer on hot to get all of the dirt out, and move onto the next room with a clean pad(same pad, just washed out). If the floor is extra dirty, like by the back door where the dogs come in, I just spray it with my favorite spray cleaner, let it sit while I do another room, and come back and the dirt lifts off nicely!

B0002JMD9A,1/1,5.0,"Duragloss 101 is a synthetic wax (a paint sealant) that cleans your paint, adds gloss and protects against mother nature. My favorite thing about DG101 is that while and excellent cleaner, it also looks great. Unlike most sealants that look very cold and sterile, this stuff makes your paint come alive. Its very wet and reflective.Pros:-Great looks-Great cleaning action combined with a light polish.-Above average durability-A little goes a long way.-Works equally well by hand or machine (use a white foam polishing pad).Cons:-The supplied applicator is kind of cheapy-Its a bit hard to find locally, Car quest is the only place I can find it.-Does not fill swirlsWhile its always good to clay before hand, you might not need to if your paint is relatively clean. This stuff is fantastic for daily drivers because it lasts 3-4 months (parked outside 24/7). Like all Duragloss products, it seems to be expensive because of the size of the container, but DG does not contain fillers so a little goes a long way. I use about 1-2 oz on a normal sized car. The durability exceed any other readily available cleaner wax including Meguiars (Cleaner, ColorX and NXT) as well as Mothers Carnauba cleaner wax.

B000CB94JU,3/3,5.0,"it's a bit more expensive that the OEM cabin filter, but the charcoal activated one seems to do a better job at keeping those exhaust fumes from entering the cabin. You know that situation- you have you AC or heat on fresh air, you're stuck in traffic, and soon enough, you smell the car exhaust from around you. Since putting this filter in though, i have not noticed any smell of fumes, so while it's new at least, it does a great job of keeping your cabin air nice and clean.",automotive

Dynomax has included a couple of extra parts that you may or may not need. One is a clamp with a hanger welded to it and the other is an adapter flange that would bolt to the catalytic converter. My 2000 Cherokee didn't need either of them.If you are doing this yourself beg, buy, borrow, steal or rent a sawzall to make things a whole lot easier. I just made a cut as close to the front of the old muffler as possible (right up against it) and removed the old exhaust in two peices. The remainder of the muffler pipe can be removed from the cat and the new Dynomax system just slips easily in to place.",automotive

B0002Q80GS,0/0,5.0,"First of all, THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS A MOUNTING BRACKET! For the first time ever, I didn't read reviews here before purchasing and bought a separate mounting bracket which Amazon lists as ""frequently purchased together"". On the flip side though, I doubled up the brackets to make them a bit more sturdy. The bracket will bend backwards from the force of pushing the 7 pin plug in otherwise.The adapter itself is made of a thick plastic so corrosion shouldn't be an issue. Both covers work well and should keep out the elements though dielectric grease should be used as well. The wires are heavy (enough) gauge and have good jackets to them and the included crimp connectors are a nice bonus, though I always recommend soldering them.My only complaint is the cheap screws that come with it. Everything needed to mount it is included but it's very soft steel and strips with little effort. Do yourself a favor and pick up some nice stainless screws at least for where it mounts to the vehicle.",automotive

This is a pure sealant, use it only on well prepped paint, it does not do any cleaning. If you want a cleaner-sealant, check out DG101.Pros-Goes on easy-Very durable, especially if you use the Polish Bonding Agent DG 601-Laminated paint look (similar to the old Zaino Z2)-Remains slick and keeps the car clean even after rain-Does not stain trim-A little goes a very long way. On a well prepped car (clay+paint cleaner), 1/2 oz should be plenty for a whole car.

B000CMHVJO,0/0,5.0,"I am a very meticulous person, especially when I am asked to drill holes in my truck, a 1995, 3/4 ton, full-sized Dodge Ram. It took me about half an hour to install this EasyLift. The next one will take about ten minutes.For my installation, I studied the installation instructions carefully to be sure that I not only understood how to install it, but also understood how the EasyLift operates.I also viewed the video on YouTube that shows how to install the EasyLift. Search for ""Hoppy EasyLift"" and you should find it. The video is called ""Hoppy Tailgate EasyLift Review"".The instructions state that two people are required to install the EasyLift. You can do it with two, but I found that three are better. I needed the most help at the final stage when I installed the tailgate and needed to maneuver the EasyLift into the hole in the tailgate.You must be very careful to drill the holes in the correct locations. My tailgate installs by placing the left-side tailgate hinge pocket over the corresponding hinge point on the truck. Then you tilt the tailgate and slide the right-side tailgate hinge pocket over the truck's right side hinge point. To do this you must be able to slide the tailgate to the left far enough to allow the tailgate's right side to clear the truck. If the hole in the tailgate is drilled too far to the left, you will not easily be able to slide the tailgate to the left far enough to gain the required clearance. I had this problem, but a strong push while my two helpers supported the tailgate got it installed.There was some slight distortion around the holes as the EasyLift rod tends to twist the holes slightly, but other than this there was no damage to the truck at all.Once installed, the EasyLift performed as advertised. It makes the tailgate MUCH easier to lift; my two helpers were both amazed. It also prevents the tailgate from dropping so forcefully when it is opened. This means that if your tailgate support cables are worn, rusty, or otherwise weakened, they are less likely to break when you open the tailgate.As a previous reviewer mentioned, once the EasyLift is installed, two people will be required to remove or replace the tailgate.The combination of a reasonable price and a large, lasting benefit make this product an easy ""buy"" decision. I will be getting two more of these, one for my newer Dodge and one for my son-in-law's truck.",automotive

Over Christmas vacation my family was mid-way through a 2,000 mile road trip, and I saw the Xantrex XPower Pocket 175-Watt Inverter for $20 in the clearance section of a local store, so I picked it up. Couldn't be happier as now we can run the laptop as much as we want. The inverter gets warm but not too hot. I never heard any noise from it, even after running for over 5 hours (looks like it has a fan on the bottom, but I never heard it running). This is the perfect inverter for us as it is very small and fits easily in the under-seat storage compartment in the van. It only has one power outlet -- if you need two outlets, look for a different model. This one is perfect for powering a laptop.Note that this model, #813-0291, does NOT have an airline adapter, but comes with two cables, one for a cigarette lighter, and one for direct connection to a 12-volt (car/boat) battery. The product probably has changed since Amazon first started selling it. My model is black, like uploaded in the photo section by R. Liu.

It may not be the best in the world (don't know), but it their products have reliable quality and performance - this is no exception. Follow the directions and use a little elbow grease (whether using a machine or by hand) and it will perform. If one application doesn't do the job, repeat and you will see improvements. It's a real mess to undo if the first application 'over performs' - so having to apply two or even three times for troublesome areas is not a negative for me. Can follow-up with 3M 39002 that is for finer work, and polish with the hand glaze for a show-car like finish.Excellent products, and not the cheapest on the market, but when looking at costs for professional paint and body work, the price really begins to make sense and the results will make concerns over price fade away.

It says that it fits a 2004 F-150 and it even came with the correct instruction manual showing pictures of my exact truck but none of it fit like it should. I believe that the polished pipe may have been bent incorrectly because when I put it on it was a good 2 inches off of where it should have pointed. I had to bend the heat shield that it came with as well as the part of the fender that the heat shield mounts to and the bracket for the pipe just to get it close to fitting. Then I had to go buy longer rubber tubing so that I could make the pipe bend just far enough to connect it. Once I was finally able to get the pipe somewhat lined up the air filter almost didn't fit. I have maybe a half of an inch from the fender. I have purchased 2 other K&N; kits for other cars and they fit perfectly but this one was awful. At this point in time I will keep it because of all of the effort I went through to put it in but if I have any problems with it I will be returning it.Aside from the fit, this looks awesome in my truck and it seems to have given it a little more power/torque but I haven't seen much of a mpg increase yet.",automotive

However, do not purchase this through Amazon -- it is NOT an authorized Optima dealer. Only an authorized Optima dealer, where you made your purchase, is obligated to replace a defective Optima battery with a new Optima. Check the Optima website for authorized dealers.The above said, Optima batteries are better purchased at your local auto parts store that is an authorized dealer for the following reasons:1. In the event of a warranty issue, it will be a simple swap.2. Eliminate the wait and reduce shipping angst. Although an Optima battery is quite rugged, when shipped in a flimsy cardboard box and then tossed around and dropped by a careless courier, the impact by the battery's heavy bulk can cause its plastic case and the internal connections to weaken, crack, or break.3. You can visually inspect a unit for physical damage from mishandling. Missing retaining fingers around the vent covers is a subtle but tell-tale sign that the unit has been mishandled.4. You can check the voltage before walking out of the store with your new battery.Hint: This is a long-lived product -- purchase through a store chain (franchise) if you anticipate relocating within three years, and do not lose your receipt.If you insist on purchasing an Optima battery online, your best bet is to order from Optima itself directly. This is the only instance that Optima (the manufacturer) will deal with you directly and give you a replacement battery. Otherwise, all warranty issues are addressed through the authorized dealer where you purchased your Optima battery.",automotive

B000E6LEJ6,5/5,4.0,"Just got it yesterday and used it today for my laptop. It works flawlessly. Some notes on the item: (i) It runs a little bit hot, but not to a point where you cannot hold it. The fan never turn on with my laptop 90W adapter attached and charging my laptop. (ii) The rating is 175W peak, 130W continuous. It didn't say so in the specification. Not a big deal since my car can supply 120W only. (iii) The blue LED is nice but a little bit weak. Should have a brighter LED in place. Am I picky on this? On my car the ciger plug does not ""lock"" properly, so it may get loose and not working. A brighter LED will help finding this out WHILE I am driving. (iv) The inverter is really small at around the size of a 2.5"" hard disk, but of course thicker. (v) No, there is no air plug, at least ""not any more"". It comes with a ciger plug and a clamp core (like those jump start cable) now. Hope these information helps any one who is looking for an inverter.",automotive

B000E6LEIC,14/16,5.0,"I've had this unit for a little over six months and it has been amazingly helpful. I bought this bad boy because the cigarette lighter in my truck went out and I am lazy about fixing it. I decided, ""Hey why not buy a new cigarette light outlet and get some AC outlets too for my truck?"" I have the tendency to eat lunch in my car and I don't want to have to run the Air Conditioning while I'm listening to my books on tape and chowing down on some grub. I find a shady spot, open the windows, clamp the fan with the cigarette lighter outlet type plug and badabing! Instant cross draft. I had plans on using this to run an electric blanket for the winter months of lunch eating, but I got laid off.Since that time, I have found a myriad of uses for this thing. For example, my sister has bad asthma and we attended an event in Atlanta over Labor Day weekend (Dragon*Con). This is a convention that hosts 40ish thousand nerds, geeks, fanboys, dweebs, sexy scantily clad hot chicks and everyone else on the spectrum. The event mostly caters to Science Fiction and Fantasy fans, but it has some pop-culture for everyone. Her asthma was so bad over this holiday we had to rent a mobility scooter because she couldn't walk the distance from our hotel to the 5 different convention hotels. We brought this bad boy and plopped it down on the floorboard of her scooter (it fit perfectly) and we didn't have to look for an outlet for her to do a nebulizer treatment. She was averaging about four to six treatments a day and we usually did them while we were waiting in line. Truly a life saver this machine is.We've also use this machine for long car trips where my sister needed to do nebulizer treatments on the way. We have a sister in Tampa and it's about a four hour drive for us and the built-in inverter my sister's car has can't handle the draw of her nebulizer. According to the Xantrex, it has about a 40 watt draw and her car just can't handle it. My sister drove around with this powerpack and her nebulizer for a couple of months until she was able to get her asthma under control. Every morning when she drove to work, she would plug in her nebulizer and do a treatment while driving to work. Her treatments last about 40 minutes and I would charge this pack every couple of weeks. I have yet to find a time when this pack hasn't had enough juice to handle extended use.Another example of how this machine saved my while unemployed is when my car battery died and I didn't have the money to get it replaced until about a month had passed and I could scrape together enough funds to get a new one. I still had to go out to interviews, shop for groceries, pick up family members, etc. This battery pack made it possible. I drove around with it on my front seat and when my engine wouldn't turn over (about 70 to 80 percent of the time) I would hook up the jumper cables and VROOM! I was on my way.I have plans on taking this thing with me on camping trips, to the beach, picnics, etc. But honestly, I've needed this unit for more practical and every day uses that I originally expected. It started out as me being lazy and not wanting to get my cigarette lighter outlet fixed and it has been a life saver on more than one occasion. Anyone considering this unit, go ahead and get it. When this one dies, I'm going to come back on here and get another one. It has already paid for itself many times over.",automotive

Perhaps I washed them incorrectly, but there were no laundry instructions included. 2) The mop is very light and the swivel head makes it easy to get at tight spots, but I'm concerned the mop handle might not be very durable because it's so thin and light.

These screws go through holes drilled through the handle and engage pre-punched holes in the sheet metal. 3 of the 4 holes in the sheet metal were correctly punched. Hole number 4 was more of a dimple than a hole and the self-tapping screw was unable to get enough ""bite"" to thread itself into the sheet metal.I used a small punch to elongate the dimple/hole enough for the self-tapping screw to get a purchase.

B000CMHVJO,0/0,4.0,"This item really does work. However, it's a little scary to see how it works. It's basically a torsion bar. You open the tailgate, and the torsion helps you raise it up. I have heard a few people say it broke, and that could be super dangerous. You can't bend it with your hands, so there is a LOT of tension on it when it's open. It was easy to drill the holes and such, but pretty hard with two people to get the bar in the right place and to get the tailgate on. It took about 20 tries and lots of sweat until it finally sat right. I found a little way of raising the tailgate to get it to fit right. They should have put it on the other side, as it would have been easier to get the tailgate on. You will see exactly what I mean when you get your on. I can tell you that you will have to drill holes in your truck, but inside the tailgate area. Not visible when shut. However, the holes do bend a little because of the torsion. It's not super pretty, but it is a tailgate and it is a truck. It's worth it not to have to lift that crazy heavy tailgate! I say get it, and you will like it.",automotive

I went with Wiseco because it was only about 20 dollars more than the OEM cast piston. Was it a good decision? I don't know. Ask me in 39 years if it lasted as well. The thing I like about Wiseco is their support network. If you have questions you can call them and talk to someone that knows what is going on. The machining tolerances are listed on the box so you know how much to bore your cylinder and what to gap the rings to.

B000E267WY,0/0,5.0,"I have had this particular receiver for more than a year now and I have no complaints about it at all. I will discuss the installation first and then what I like about it.I installed this on my 1991 F150 with what I consider only a modest amount of work. It took me about 3 hours from moving my truck into the garage to hooking up my first trailer. Here are some hints that I can pass on:Invest in some vice grips if you have none. I clammed the receiver to the frame to do a dry fit before I drilled my first hole. I spent about 30 minutes making sure I liked how it lined up and then I drilled pilot holes for the bolt holes with the receiver still clamped to the frame. This was to try to ensure that the holes were about as centered as possible so the bolts would line up nicely. Here is the biggest issue...use a corded drill. I don't think the battery powered drills have the torque nor juice to make it without having a hard time. I also decided to use a spray lube to keep the bit from binding from excessive heat. It will take some shoulder power to get the holes drilled, but once they are, the rest is a snap.Once I got the holes drilled, I removed the vice grips and receiver and deburred the holes. Having a helper here is a good idea, but not necessary. I first dropped in all six bolts into the holes, lifted the receiver into place, and then tightened them snug, alternating the order and switching sides for each bolt; left rear to right front, left front to right center, left center to right rear. I did each in incremental tightening, about six different times to reach the torque specified. Probably more work than necessary, but I didn't want to risk tweaking the frame/receiver.The space is a bit tight here, so I used an open box for the bolt head and my torque wrench with a deep well socket for the nut.Now why I like this receiver over some of the others:The largest reason I like this receiver is the construction. It is one hefty piece of equipment. In looking at the other manufactures and models available for my truck, I liked the safety chain hook-up on this one the best. While the other models use a wire loop for the chain, this one uses a plate welded to the square tube with a hole cut out for the hooks. While I am sure the wire loops work more than well enough, it just seems to me to be the weakest link. This set up feels more secure to me. Sometimes the hooks don't fit in the holes well, so I have installed carabiners that are stronger than even the towing capacity to help with this. It only seems to be an issue with older trailer safety chain hooks. But again, it is a small price to pay for an amazing receiver.All in all, even with the effort to install, I would recommend this receiver to anyone who asks (provided it fits your rig). 5 stars all around.",automotive

It is complete garbage.The case is a joke. Don't be fooled by the picture. The gray lining on the inside (which is black on mine), which is supposed to hold the riveter and rivets in place, is made of the cheapest super thin cellophane-like plastic. It was already damaged when the tool arrived, and it develops a new crack in it every time I remove and replace the tool. It is also complete garbage.More on the riveter: The threading in the hole where the nipple is attached, was nicely pre-stripped when it arrived. So badly, that I had to use a heavy ratchet wrench and a bench vise to remove the one that was installed from the factory. And had to use the same tools to attach the one that I needed. After removing and reattaching one several times, I was able to re-establish the threading, but even if the tool functioned at all (which it doesn't), I wouldn't expect the threads to hold up for long.I would return this, but the seller insists that I pay for return shipping even though the tool is clearly defective. I'm not going to invest another dime in this trash. Should've known to just go to Sears and stick with Craftsman tools. Don't waste your money on this pathetically inferior product.",automotive

B000CIT2LS,2/3,5.0,"I purchased this cat back system two years ago when my original exhaust was showing sign of failure. I wanted a stainless steel cat back but the high price for an old vehicle didn't make sense to me. Since the original exhaust wasn't leaking I put off the installation but I finally decided to take the plunge this past weekend.Removal of the original exhaust was the hardest part but a sawzall and a Dremel with a cut off wheel helped. The system fit my 1999 Cherokee like a glove and I too didn't need the flange adapter that comes with the kit. Leave the clamps loose until you align everything and then tighten them down from the cat back. For extra piece of mind I pinned the muffler-to-cat and tail pipe-to-muffler connections with a stainless screw to keep things from turning or sliding off. My biggest concern is having to replace the exhaust every two years due to rust but a previous poster made it five years which sounds good to me.The exhaust has a nice 'deep' tone to it without it being loud or obnoxious and it doesn't drone at all. The whole system comes in one large box. The muffler is in a separate box in the box and all of the clamps, a hanger/clamp, and a flange adapter are included. The tailpipe has a hanger welded on near the muffler and a chrome tip which isn't show quality but more than I expected. Be careful around the chrome tip though. the outer edge was roughly ground and rather sharp to the touch. I took care of that with my Dremel.I am pleased with the quality for the price and it fit exactly like the original OEM exhaust with no modifications.",automotive

It was a much cheaper charger, and half the weight of this one.Update:I was just about to use this charger, and am glad I didn't.It has a large bolt rattling around inside the charger.I then started the replacement request, and Amazon quickly made it right.As soon as I un-boxed this charger, I closely inspected it, then plugged it in, and tested it.

B000E2CP02,3/5,1.0,"If you are purchasing this to replace your stock OEM filter then you have some more research to conduct. To my dismay I ordered this filter to do just that and hoped for the boost in performance that I have always received from K&N. For an automobile this has always been a great investment. However, for a motorcycle like the Suzuki VL800 the tolerences are tighter on airflow. After install my bike seemed to have a lower compression and would sputter and lurch through operation....hmmm thought this was going to boost performance? After searching the forums, I found that the air/gas mix ratio on a bike is a different issue. Seems the forums have suggested either modifying the air intake, fuel injection or the pipes. Most said to do it all...far cry from a replacement filter job. Now this advice is only my limited opinion as an end user. I am not a tech junkie nor a motorcycle repairman. I just write this to inform those that just want a simple replacement for the OEM filter. For me this was a bust.

This holds your bike somewhere in the middle, sandwiched between 2 metal plates. The problem is if you're only carrying one bike, the plates don't seem to clamp down properly.

B000FGJSZC,0/0,2.0,"This is the first K&N; CAI that I have bought that I did not like at all. It says that it fits a 2004 F-150 and it even came with the correct instruction manual showing pictures of my exact truck but none of it fit like it should. I believe that the polished pipe may have been bent incorrectly because when I put it on it was a good 2 inches off of where it should have pointed. I had to bend the heat shield that it came with as well as the part of the fender that the heat shield mounts to and the bracket for the pipe just to get it close to fitting. Then I had to go buy longer rubber tubing so that I could make the pipe bend just far enough to connect it. Once I was finally able to get the pipe somewhat lined up the air filter almost didn't fit. I have maybe a half of an inch from the fender. I have purchased 2 other K&N; kits for other cars and they fit perfectly but this one was awful. At this point in time I will keep it because of all of the effort I went through to put it in but if I have any problems with it I will be returning it.Aside from the fit, this looks awesome in my truck and it seems to have given it a little more power/torque but I haven't seen much of a mpg increase yet.",automotive

B000E6LEIC,31/31,5.0,"First off, don't think this unit would be able to replace a generator if you need any kind of heavy duty power for an extended period of time. A 1,000 watt generator would do you much better. However, for this little unit which has a 28 Amp-Hour, non-spillable, AGM battery and using it to power some lights (like CFL's) and a notebook computer or two, recharging small electrical items (mobile phones, iPod's, portable DVD players, etc.), this fits the bill perfectly.I've been using two of these units for a little over a month now and couldn't be happier. As another reviewer said, one of the huge pro's over this versus a generator is that it's much quieter. It's dead silent until you are pulling about 300 watts and that's where the internal-fan inside the unit starts to turn on and the speed of the fan is dependent on how much load you're putting on it.The display indicator tells you exactly, in 10-watt increments, of how much power you're pulling. Also, the three 120VAC outlets are a definite plus and in most cases, I do not have to carry a power-strip around with me to plug in all of the devices I need to use while on the road or camping.Also, the 12VDC cigarette-lighter outlet doubles both as a power-source and as a way to charge the battery. Using the included AC-adapter to recharge the battery pack is relatively slow, almost a trickle charge, but when you're on the go, you can use the included DC-DC cable to charge the battery pack at a much higher current rate. There is also a plug for the included jumper cables so you can use the battery as a jump-start source for reviving dead car batteries in an emergency.The built-in light and radio are functional. Nothing fancy and works as advertised. More gimmicks in themselves unless you're in emergency situations a lot. But nice to have. Only small wish is that on top of the AM and FM bands that it supports, having the WX channels would make it truly more of an ""emergency"" radio.If you're looking for a minimal amount of clean, non-gas burning, portable power for a camping trip or for emergency situations, then this unit fits the bill perfectly.",automotive

Can't really tighten it any tighter as, once it is ""locked"", it just spins. So, it doesn't fit correctly even though it is the correct part number for my particular vehicle.

I don't see that it really gave me anything though, I don't feel or notice a difference in power, torque or anything else. It does seem to start a bit quicker with this rather than the points.Lastly, the reason 3 stars instead of 5? The directions were incredibly ""drama queen."" You can easily install these, but the directions make it seem like you're gonna burn a hole through the center of the earth if you don't hold your tongue right while installing them. Directions are unclear and waaayy overboard on the ""BE SURE TO.."" and capitalizations of WARNINGS!!ALSO: The rotor is bizzare, and I'm pretty sure its a piece of crap. I almost stripped the key out of it because it fits so tight, I had to hammer it down. It's freaking weird.

I can confirm that this part is 100% identical and compatible with an 01 Monte Carlo SS (most likely all Montes and Impalas of similar vintage as well). Only difficult part of accessing the component is removing the driver's side seatbelt retaining stud.Turns out I was right: water, potentially from the left-side sunroof track drain tube which turns out to be routed very close, had dripped onto the +12V line / spade connector running into the bottom of the control unit, shorted the circuit, and melted it.

Thinking it was the alternator (it couldn't be the battery, its brand new after all), my shop tested the alternator, starter, and battery. The alternator and starter came back as working just fine. The battery on the other hand came back bad. As the battery comes with a 36 month warranty I contacted Optima to try and resolve the issue. NOTE: OPTIMA WILL NOT WARRANTY ANY BATTERIES PURCHASED THROUGH AMAZON. Optima basically told me that I had to take the battery back where I purchased it. I told them it was Amazon and they stated that they never recommend someone buy a battery through Amazon because Amazon will not honor the warranty. They basically told me that the warranty is worthless. I tried contacting Amazon, who never responded to my repeated inquiries.My mechanic also told me that he tells everyone to never buy Optima batteries, as he has had nothing but trouble with them. Also note, Optima batteries cannot be recharged like a conventional battery and must go through a long complicated process to get them to charge. Your can read about how to recharge an Optima battery on their website. The process is pretty ridiculous.The bottom line is I would never recommend an Optima battery to anyone and will never again purchase one myself. However, if you are dead set on buying an Optima, DO NOT PURCHASE IT THROUGH AMAZON! Amazon may be slightly cheaper, but they will not honor the warranty, try Kragen or Napa or another local shop.

B0002KL6TM,5/6,5.0,"I used the very excelent Sea Foam motor treatment to clean the carbs on a very rough sounding motorcycle after being stored for the winter. Biased on my success with that product I decided to give this penetrating fluid product a try. In the past I have used many types of fluids that claim to help break up rust and grime that keep bolts from coming lose. Most are junk for a number of reasons but Deep Creep seems to work.Deep Creed claims to be paint safe, working around cars this can be very important. I tested this and those claims seem to be true (be sure to test for yourself before going crazy). Next up is that the product foams and seems to stay mostly where you spray it. Light fluid sprays like WD40 just seem to run but Deep Creep clings much better for a few seconds until the foam slowly turns to liquid. I would say the foaming is much like the old Break Free products. So for a large area Deep Creep would not be my first choice but for stubborn bolts and such it works perfectly.My first test of this product was some stubborn bolt/screw combo heads used to hold a license plate on the back of my wife's car, your standard SUV that has been covered in salt and grime for years without ever removing the plates. The bolts were of course cheep and started to strip as soon as they saw a screwdriver. More then that, getting behind the bolts would be hard because they had a wide head and the way the plate rested inset into a decorative bracket directly against the SUV. Basically the rusted bolts were half striped, hard to reach, and right next to surfaces I didn't want to damage. A quick squirt of this product with 5 mins of waiting and the bolts came right out, no problem. The foam quality really helped get behind the bolt and license plate to reach the body panel insert where the bolt connected.This is the best thing I have ever used to tackle rusted bolts and worth giving a try.",automotive

As a locking gas cap, it appears to be delivering exactly what it is supposed to, and at a good price. Given that it just screws in with no apparent locking points, I wondered how it could work. Think child-proof drug container cap, where the top just spins unless you deal with it the right way. With this cap, your key causes the outer cap to engage with the inner, screw-in part. Without the key, the outer section just spins and the inner plug stays put. I'm sure that with the right tools and no interruptions, it could be defeated, but I'm betting that a gas thief will tend to move on to something easier. Recommended.",automotive
B000MSBUA4,28/29,5.0,"This is officially my sixth Optima Yellow Top battery, and the first that has had an issue requiring warranty support. Unfortunately, I was told by Optima that Amazon is not on their authorized retailer list therefore I am unable to take it to a local retailer for warranty support. I also confirmed via my Amazon account that it cannot be returned to Amazon. What to do, what to do. Well, even though it is only 9 months old, I bought a brand new Optima from my local Autozone that I know will be an easy exchange should I ever have an issue again.Now, on to the battery: These have worked well for me in multiple applications from HD trucks to multi-amp-ed Trans Am's and even an off-road Jeep. I've never had one fail until now but be aware that these are not ""plug-and-play"" batteries like a wet lead-acid type that most people use and/or grew up with when it comes to charging. I'd suggest visiting Optima's web site and reading the differences between their Red, Yellow and Blue top batteries so you understand their application and the type of care and feeding they require. The Yellow covers both cranking amps for starter motors as well as deep-cycle capacity for applications with a large amperage draw such as amplifiers and accessories like winches and such. I've averaged over 6 years out of each battery until I had this one fail and two were going strong when the vehicles left my possession.I'm guessing that a number of those who are saying this is a bad battery or doesn't last haven't taken the time to learn about them. They can be drained completely down and yet recover where a standard battery won't. But, and it is a big but, they must be recovered following very specific procedures and no, you can't simply hook up a charger and expect it to recover automatically. Do some research and you'll confirm what I already know, these are not standard batteries and yes, they are better than your standard wet-cell batteries, in my opinion. For me, they've outlasted every other type of battery I've used and are what I buy when the stock battery dies or when I need more power for accessories. Peace.",automotive

If you use a dry towel, the rubbing compound will dry up quickly and stick to the towel. Use a damp (very damp) piece of cloth towel to apply this stuff. An old wash cloth or hand towel works great. Rub it on the car with a circular motion. When the applicator towel becomes grimey, wash it with soap and warm water then continue. Or, use a fresh piece of damp towel. You can rub out small scuffs and scratches with this stuff. Allow the products to dry to a haze then use a soft, clean, dry towel to wipe it off. It comes off very easily.

If the floor is extra dirty, like by the back door where the dogs come in, I just spray it with my favorite spray cleaner, let it sit while I do another room, and come back and the dirt lifts off nicely!

I post on a few automotive forums and have become aware that stripped threads in aluminum heads and stripped wheel lug studs and nuts are pretty common... What has been happening is that nuts and bolts are being over tightened even when torqued to recommended specs due to the reduction of friction caused by use of anti-seize compound... The way I have been getting away with using the stuff is by tightening the dry (without anti-seize coating) nut, bolt or whatever to where the bolt head or nut or threaded part makes contact with the surface of what is being tightened .. Using a torque wrench count the amount of, degrees or fractional turns of the wrench when specified torque is reached... Loosen and remove the fastener coat the male threads and tighten to the same amount of turns as when at specified torque... On my Honda, Subaru, Cadillac and other cars and bikes with aluminum heads I use anti-seize compound on I use a Sharpie pencil to mark the spark plug socket and put 1/3 or 120 degrees of a turn on after the sealing surface makes contact ar after the crush washer is fully compressed......

B000E6LEJ6,11/11,5.0,"My family takes our 12-inch Powerbook G4 on road trips for showing movies and doing other computer stuff on the road, but the battery would often give out after 2-3 hours rendering the laptop unusable until we could charge the battery again. Over Christmas vacation my family was mid-way through a 2,000 mile road trip, and I saw the Xantrex XPower Pocket 175-Watt Inverter for $20 in the clearance section of a local store, so I picked it up. Couldn't be happier as now we can run the laptop as much as we want. The inverter gets warm but not too hot. I never heard any noise from it, even after running for over 5 hours (looks like it has a fan on the bottom, but I never heard it running). This is the perfect inverter for us as it is very small and fits easily in the under-seat storage compartment in the van. It only has one power outlet -- if you need two outlets, look for a different model. This one is perfect for powering a laptop.Note that this model, #813-0291, does NOT have an airline adapter, but comes with two cables, one for a cigarette lighter, and one for direct connection to a 12-volt (car/boat) battery. The product probably has changed since Amazon first started selling it. My model is black, like uploaded in the photo section by R. Liu. The silver photo must be the old model that included the airline adapter.",automotive

It's easy to remember when to use which one. Blue is for deep cycle marine applications and should be used in all marine applications.

I think I'm going to end up sort of brushing off the dust pads before washing them. Even though it's wide, the mop is narrow enough that it can get into nooks and crannies about as well as a Swiffer can.As a mop, this thing blew me away. I could not believe how well it cleaned even tough, dried up stains with JUST WATER. My mop came with two damp mop pads (and three dry ones!), and they covered my far-less-than-spotless floors with no problem. How nice not to have to deal with buckets of nasty water for wringing and rinsing. At one point one of them started drying up and I just wet it a little and it kept going. Also, it did a much better job than ordinary mops of getting rid of those stringy left-behinds that other mops just push around.I have dogs and I'm always worried about them walking on a floor washed with harsh chemicals and then licking their paws.

B000E6LEIC,374/383,5.0,"After spending my vacation in Florida during hurricane Wilma, I learned the value of being prepared for a prolonged power outage. This unit would have been just the thing.This is essentially a big 12 volt battery and an inverter that produces 120v AC from the battery. While this unit won't power a heater or an air conditioner, it can power a small fan overnight so you can sleep. It can also charge your cell phone and laptop. (After all, your laptop's DVD player might be your only entertainment.) The XPower can power a lamp so you can read or play cards, or you can watch a small TV for a few hours. You can plug in just about anything so long as the total number of watts drawn is 480 or less. (The 600 watt rating is a 5 minute rating, you can only draw 480 watts continuously.) Keep in mind, if you do pull 480 watts, you'll only get 15 minutes of run time. It's best to think of the 600HD as a way to keep small essentials going.There's an emergency light built-in. if you place the unit so the light bounces off a near-by wall, it makes a nice low-level room light. With the backside facing you, you see the built-in clock radio. It's not hi-fi, but it's not horrible, it has good volume and it can wake you in the morning. There's also a 12v outlet and a connector for attaching the supplied jumper cables.You do have to be mindful of the number of watts you pull from the unit if you want the battery to last. It's easy to know how many watts you're drawing because the unit tells you on it's digital display. It's a good thing you can charge the XPower from a car cigarette lighter. During my adventure in Wilma's wake, I would have used the XPower by night and charged it in the car while driving during the day. The digital display also shows the percentage of charge left in the battery.The best thing to have during a prolonged power outage is a gas generator. But generators require periodic maintenance. And you have to store fresh gas and remember to change the gas periodically. With the HD600, you just find an out-of-the-way corner, plug in the AC charger and forget all about it until the lights go out.The XPower has a big 28 amp-hour battery which is good for capacity, but makes the unit heavy, almost 30 pounds, so you won't want to carry it very far. Xantrex makes smaller units, but I think the 600 is the best compromise between capacity and portability. The XPower's construction is robust and it looks like it could take some hard knocks.",automotive

B000CMHVJO,0/0,4.0,"This item really does work. However, it's a little scary to see how it works. It's basically a torsion bar. You open the tailgate, and the torsion helps you raise it up. I have heard a few people say it broke, and that could be super dangerous. You can't bend it with your hands, so there is a LOT of tension on it when it's open. It was easy to drill the holes and such, but pretty hard with two people to get the bar in the right place and to get the tailgate on. It took about 20 tries and lots of sweat until it finally sat right. I found a little way of raising the tailgate to get it to fit right. They should have put it on the other side, as it would have been easier to get the tailgate on. You will see exactly what I mean when you get your on. I can tell you that you will have to drill holes in your truck, but inside the tailgate area. Not visible when shut. However, the holes do bend a little because of the torsion.

B000E6LEIC,8/11,3.0,"Does a reasonable job. We actually bought the power source to run our 12V camping fridge and lights both when camping, and on road trips when the car is switched off. It should have a heavier duty charger so that you can leave your 12V devices plugged in when you plug it into the mains to charge (doing that will apparently overload / burn the charger out). I have no faith in the digital readout - it ran my camping fridge for a couple of hours. After shutting it off for a couple of hours it claimed to have 0% charge left, then after that it continued to run the fridge overnight without the battery dropping low enough for the fridge's automatic low battery cut out.For what it is though (an emergency battery / power source), it seems to do quite an adequate job.I haven't had reason to try the car jump start feature, so I don't know if the battery can really provide enough CCA to do that. I do question however, that it would jump the car safely now when all computer managed engines are supposed to only be jumped with surge protected jumper leads.

B000E6LEIC,2/2,5.0,"Reviewed everyone's comments about this device and no one said anything bad so I decided to give it a try. My mom and I used it over the July 4th weekend while we were camping, it worked great. This device is easy to use, I am able to carry it and it charged my cell phone and my lap top repeatedly. I did not want to deal with a gas generator, being rather engine illiterate this item was a perfect option. I highly recommend it to any woman that wants something to charge those items you need. It is not to big, I put it right behind the drivers seat on the floor and stacked sleeping bags on it, no worries about gas leakage and vapors. When I needed it a flip of the switch and open the socked cover and it was ready to go. If I needed a light in camp I had access to a very easy one on the device. This was a great buy and will be traveling again with us in October for a three week camping trip having that ability to recharge it using my car's lighter is a great bonus.

B000CGI52C,2/2,1.0,"The product description says, ""...Foam Case Seals included.""*However, there are no foam seals included. I bought this item instead of a lower priced item because my old seals were not that good and I wanted the new ones that were supposed to be included with this item. But this heater core came without the new seals, and I needed my vehicle and couldn't wait to ship this heater core back and get a different one, so I had to use my old seals anyway.Also, the packaging was poor. The inlet and outlet tubes were a little out of whack because of this, and several of the cooling fins were bent over. Basically, they put the heater core between two pieces of that fluffed-up brown paper stuff and threw it in a box that was not well-sized. It could move around all over the place and the part did not stay between the paper filler. So it banged around in the box and torqued the inlet and outlet tubes a bit where they exit the core tank. It also rattled around and damaged the cooling fins a bit in several places. But, like I said, I needed my vehicle and couldn't wait any longer to fix it, so I put it on.The product may be good. I hope so, because replacing the heater core again isn't something I really want to do. But this product only received a 1 star rating from me because it did not include new foam seals like the advertisement here says it would.I don't blame Amazon for this. I blame the supplier, AutoPartsWAY. I will not buy from them again. They are a poor seller who advertises falsely about what is included with the product and they package their product worse than any package I have ever received.Had I not needed my truck, and had I been able to wait to return this and get something else, I would have returned it.

I have found comfort riding my 2006 Kawasaki Vulcan 900 Classic LT because I think the vibration of the bike really helps my back. The problem was, the factory seat was such a cheap piece that I couldn't ride long distances with it.Pros:- Quality. This thing is hand built. The leather is hand stitched, the foam is Mustang's on custom made foam, the base of the seat is cast right in house and these things are assembled with the top quality in mind. The leather is nice and everything is solid- Fit. Using the factory hardware, this thing fit nice and snug. Once installed, it is not loose and doesn't vibrate at all.- Support. This thing has the perfect firmness and support. The passanger seat acts as a back rest and provides a great deal of lumbar support for my lower back.- Directions. As all good products should, this came with bike specific instructions on how to install the seat with pictures and everything- Looks. This thing looks so much better than the stock seat on my bike. It really stands out as a quality piece.Cons:- Price. This thing is pricey but it is hand made and top quality which makes the high cost a bit easier to swallow.- This thing sits higher and farther back from the handlebars which made me change the risers to bring the handlebars closer to me. I am 6' 4"" tall with pretty long arms so if I needed risers, I'm sure shorter people would as well.This thing, to me, is worth every penny.

However, after activating the GM Enhanced Data I found out that it was still not able to display some of the enhanced data such as CAM Retard, which is what I needed to set the distributor on by GM Vehicle. The standard features worked good, fast communication between scanner and vehicle, and you can clear codes without having to shut the engine down (cheaper scanners force you to have the engine off to reset the fault codes). If SPX can get all of the enhanced data working on this scanner I would give it a 5. My best word of advice before you buy, search forums and call SPX tech support to verify the data you need is available on the scanner.",automotive
B000GOF4NI,0/0,5.0,Used this for a 1999 Chrysler Cirrus and looks different then the auto part stores because they sell the motor only. Gettting the whole unit saved time and was much easier to install. Wires plugged in with fitting so no wire cutting no removal of blade etc...

It has 3 screws and a difficult plug into the resistor and then it was installed.,automotive

As a result, the unit has drastically lowered the reliability of power availability - precisely the opposite of what it is intended to do.I bought two of these units from Amazon, and will return them. I have since bought an APC XS-1500 which has less features, but works like a charm.I spoke to Xantrex technical support, but they had no solution other than ""sorry, please return them and try to get another one from a different batch date"".

A trip to O'Reilys auto fixed the problem. I needed to cut the breather tube as well to avoid kinks. This kit doesn't come with instructions, so if you're not handy with auto, go to the Volant website for an install picture, and a simple diagram that may assist you.Two last pieces of advise-Be extremely careful when removing the IAT sensor. The plastic around the sensor is fairly brittle and chips easily.When inserting the IAT sensor and new elbow fitting into the Volant air duct's gromits, use a little greese. The fitting is EXTREMELY tight (which means it's a quality seal), but a pain to get in. A small amount of greeze make's the job more manageable.",automotive

B00030BFJW,75/79,5.0,"Want to feel like a superhero? Keep one of these devices in your trunk. The next time you see someone stranded at the trailhead or in the mall parking lot with a dead battery, waiting for dad or hubby or AAA, you'll make their day. Pop the hood, connect the cables, crank the key, unhook the cables, and they're on their way. The whole thing takes less than a minute. If you're the dad or hubby who's always running out to the rescue, this handy piece of equipment will make your job a lot easier. And if you're the one who's found himself stranded, here's a simple, self-sufficient solution to keep it from ever happening again.The local auto parts places often advertise similar no-name units for lower prices. They're usually bright yellow. I've owned a couple, and have had mixed results. The power switch broke on one the first time I used it, and the battery wouldn't hold a charge either. What's more frustrating than pulling out a portable jump-starter to rescue someone with a dead battery and discovering that the jump-starter also has a dead battery? The other ""no-name"" model I bought is still working well, but a 50% success rate isn't anything to brag about. You can look at the reviews for similar units sold here on the site and see what I mean.I grabbed this model because Schumacher is a well-established brand much less likely to sell no-name poorly-made junk. It seems well-built, is very compact, and hasn't given me any problems yet.I'm surprised more small businesses don't own these. If I owned a bar, restaurant, or retail store, I'd keep one of these charged and ready behind the counter -- think of the goodwill they could generate.One disadvantage to this unit: some models include additional features like a flashlight (which makes it easier to see under the hood in the dark), an air compressor, or a cigarette lighter outlet, which lets you use the device as a portable power supply. I've even seen one model with an integrated voltage inverter, which lets you power standard 120 volt household products. However, these all add size, weight, cost, and complexity to the product. If you're looking for a compact jump-starter that does its job well, this one's a good choice.",automotive

B000E6LEIC,87/88,4.0,"WARNING!!!Like many people I plugged this PowerPack into the wall overnight, and waited for the blinking green light to hold steady to indicate full charge. Then it was time for some fun testing to see how long the battery would last powering certain things. My first test was powering a 9 watt LED (for emergency lighting). According tot he box, it should run for at least 32 hours straight. I got 18 hours in practice. I tried a laptop that should be powered for 7 hours (lasted for 4 hours before battery went to zero).Needless to say I was ticked!! WTF! Half run-times?!?! Then I read the instruction (and it's real easy to overlook in the booklet), the first time charging is CRITICAL to the performance of this PowerPack.VERY VERY IMPORTANT! When you first get your PowerPack, you need to charge it for AT LEAST 48 hours. The reason is many of these packs are stored in warehouses for months and never recharged. Charging just till when the Green light stays steady is NOT when it's full during the FIRST CHARGE. That just means the VOLTAGE is where it needs to be, the diminished AMPERAGE takes more time to build back up than the 28 to 36 hours some people assume.You can leave it plugged into the wall for a week, and the PowerPack will run at full capacity from that point on. After that point, you can charge for 24 to 36 hours (from empty battery status) and you should be good to go. The AC wall plug has a ""Plug and Forget"" system. So when it's done charging, the system goes into maintenance mode. So you can leave it plugged in all the time.==== THE REVIEW ======The battery is based on Watt Usage. Here are the official AC run-times (I was able to confirm many of these times):5 watts = Cordless Phone = 56 hrs8 watts = Clock Radio = 35 hrs10 watts= Portable stereo = 28 hrs14 watts= CFL light bulb = 20 Hrs15 watts= Portable DVD player = 19 Hrs40 watts= Laptop (idle) = 7 hrs60 watts= Small 13"" TV = 4.5 hrs190 watts= 3/8 Drill = 50 min276 watts= Sander = 30 minThe LED meter shows wattage being consumed. To check battery level, you need turn off the AC inverter and hold the button down to check battery level. Personally, I would have preferred a meter that allowed me to choose which info I would like displayed. I would have found knowing battery remaining info more useful than watts used.=== CHARGING ===The biggest PRO I can mention is the many ways you can charge this pack! Here are the charging methods and my experiences:AC charging - Takes 36 hours max to charge from the AC (from empty battery). The AC adapter is really a DC converter outputting 12 volts @ 2.5 amps to the PowerPack. This is charged through a small charging port that can handle NO MORE THAN 2.5 AMPS.DC Charging - You charge using a separate cigarette lighter input. The pack comes with a 2 ended cigarette adaptor cable. Plug one end into the PowerPack's cigarette port, and the other into the car's cigarette port. Takes 4 to 6 hours to charge. Great way to charge on road trips.Solar Charging - You can charge the pack with a 5 to 30 watt unregulated portable solar panel as long it doesn't output more than 2.5 AMPs using the smaller port where the AC adaptor would go. The charging times TAKES DAYS! It's fine if you are using the PowerPack lightly and have good sunlight. You can recharge in a day using the 30 watt solar panel. So for camping, it does have a major benefit for LIGHT USE like charging USB electronics. If you use it for any heavy use and you will need to charge for days to make the PowerPack usable.Alternative Charging - I found this on my own. If an car alternator can charge this PowerPack via the cigarette port, so can ANY 12 volt REGULATED be used to charge this battery. I have a 90 watt solar panel outputting 3.5 AMPS and able to charge this pack in under 6 to 9 hours. The solar panel or alternative power source needs a 12 volt charge controller to prevent overcharging. I have tested large wattage solar panels, a waterwheel generator, and a bike pedal generator, and they all work. The key is the charge controller and a cigarette adaptor.EXTRA CAR BATTERY - Not really a charging method. The pack has a car boosting port and jumper cable attachment (used for jump starting car batteries). You can use this jumper cables and attach them to a Fully charged car battery and extend the battery capacity. Currently the Pack has 28 Amp hours. Connect to a car battery with 45 Amp Hours, and now your Power pack has 73 Amp Hours. You can use the AC inverter to use this extra power for extra long run-times.==== Jump Starting a Car ======I was able to jump start a 2004 V6 Toyota Corolla, a 1998 V6 Toyota Tacoma Pickup,and a V8 Toyota Tundra. No problem at all. The PowerPack worked great!==== Radio and 5 watt built-in Light ======Radio is okay. Not great. Perfectly fine in a survival situation and you need news. Listening to music sucks. The run- time is roughly over 1 month. It has a digital clock with alarm. Haven't tested that, and looks a bit on the cheap side.The 5 watt light should have been a LED bulb in my opinion. Will run for 56 hours. Decent light but not the brightest. Perfectly fine for a blackout and providing temporary light.==== Portability and Sound ===It's has a nice carrying handle that distributes the weight and I have no problem carrying this around. Weighs about the same as a regular car battery. The pack is not as big as the picture makes it look. it's actually more compact than I thought. Sound-wise, it's silent.===== BOTTOM LINE ======It's a great portable, multi-chargeable, light duty power pack. JUST MAKE SURE TO CHARGE IT FOR A WEEK DURING THE FIRST CHARGE.",automotive

B000B8JUEI,1/1,1.0,"Purchased this for a 1978 Chevy Silverado. When the cap is placed on the truck and locked, a seal is not created. Consequently, if the tank is full, fuel can escape- or fumes are escaping most the time. A thicker o-ring would likely solve the problem.",automotive

B000GSERXW,0/0,5.0,"This jacket is great. I kind of regret getting the white one because it will get dirty faster than the black or blue, but the jacket is very good. I am a Florida driver and when you take the inside liner out and open the vents you can stay fairly cool knowing that you have titanium and top quality elbow pads as protection. The inside liner can keep you very warm, but don't be mistaken, this isn't a winter jacket. Great buy. The white is really nice, I am just worried about going through a patch of bugs. So far it has been a month and is perfectly clean, but I will see later when the bugs come out. The look is a little...hmmm...muscular? if that makes sense. Sometimes I feel like I am wearing a fake muscle suit, but if that doesnt bother you, I would strongly recommend the jacket.",automotive

B000E6LEIC,1/1,3.0,"I had this since last year. I used this as a portable power for my trimmer to trim my yard when I reached a farther place away my home power plugs. I did this routinely about once per month. It worked fine for about 10 months for me. However, a few weeks ago while I was again doing the regular trimming, this unit suddenly burst out smoke and stopped working. Apparently that it had been damaged by short circuit. Fortunately there was no explosion. However, I am very bothered by the fact that it does not have an effective fuse to prevent such short circuit from happening. Now the unit is partially burned. I do not think it is reparable. I need to contact my local recycle center to recycle it. I expected that it should work for at least 3 years for me. But its life span is much shorter than I have expected.",automotive
B0002Q80UO,0/0,5.0,The part was exactly as described. The instructions were very clear and also told the level of degree of installation from easy to hard.

This was so easy I believe my wife could have wired the trailer herself and she has no exprience of this type. I used this product along with 25'. What I thought was going to take hours took less than an hour. Thank you.,automotive
B000F5KF96,1/3,3.0,"My problem is not with the transmitters themselves but rather with the way they were packaged and shipped. This device includes, in addition to the unique code label on the device itself, a facility code of an additional 2 digits which provides further security (additional uniqueness of code). This additonal code was not supplied with the device. The manufacturer normally sells these in blocks of ten (I ordered ten) which are consecutive code numbers with the facility code labeled on the outer package. The entry system is programmed to be able to enter these codes in blocks rather than each individually. I received 10 randomly coded devices thrown in a box without any packing or identification of the facility code. As I chose to keep them rather than return I have limited reason to complain I suppose. Other than the foregoing the transmitters work fine.",automotive

It charged my Zune, but took pretty much two of these using the USB charging outlet to charge it from completely empty (non-functioning) to completely full (green battery icon). I plugged in my Zune AC wall charger into the pocket power AC outlet and had a little more success. It didn't quite take two. It didn't charge my laptop.I gave it two stars based on the Amazon price.
